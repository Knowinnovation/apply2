      To change the background image:
      1. Add new image to ../../images/ folder
      2. Open main.css
      3. Press Ctrl+F and search "banner"
      4. Replace "banner.jpg" with the new image name in the following:
            background-image: url('../../images/banner.jpg');
      Note: keep the ../../images/ if the new image is stored in the images folder

      OR change the background image by deleting "banner.jpg" in the images folder and then upload a new image titled "banner.jpg" to the same location.

              To add a new section:
              1. Add <h3> section for heading
              2. Add <p> section(s) for paragraphs of text

             <!--<h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>We need your help to develop a systems level understanding of how cancer therapies or cancer itself interacts with the gut microbiome to alter or be altered by mental health?.</p>
            -->
            
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The stress of a cancer diagnosis can impinge upon a patient's physical and behavioral health, including changes of mental health such as the onset of depression and/or anxiety and substance use. These behavioral health issues can be exacerbated by side effects of cancer treatments, which can range from mild to severe, and often dramatically impact the gut microbiome. In the absence of cancer, changes in the microbiome called dysbiosis are known to impact mental health through the gut-brain axis.</p>
            <p>Because cancer treatments can alter the microbiome, there is likely a systemic relationship between cancer treatments, the gastrointestinal system, including the microbiome, and mental health. Therapeutic interventions are selected to achieve a clinical outcome but, as more problems arise, additional pharmaceutical or therapeutic interventions are administered — some of which might be self-prescribed (such as over-the-counter supplements or cannabis products) — creating a complex “polypharmacy” state. These interventions may have unanticipated direct or indirect consequences on both mental health and the gut microbiome.</p>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute seeks to develop a systems level understanding of how cancer therapies or cancer itself interacts with the gut microbiome to alter or be altered by mental health.</p>
            <p>The Ideas Lab will identify and develop key research proposals which would create breakthrough in terms of systems level understanding.</p>
            <p>We will encourage the formation of collaborative teams working at the intersection of the fields of Cancer, the Microbiome and Mental Health.</p>
            
            <h3>The Event</h3>
            <p>The Ideas Lab is designed to identify the research questions that will develop a systems level understanding of how cancer therapies or cancer itself interacts with the gut microbiome to alter or be altered by mental health.</p>
            <p>At the same time we are keen to encourage the creation of interdisciplinary teams who might choose to collaborate at the intersection of Cancer, the Microbiome and Mental Health.</p>  
            <p>The Ideas Lab will be held over 4 days blah blah </p>         

            <h3>How To Register</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute encourages applications from any party interested in actively participating in discussions and challenges about cancer, the microbiome, and mental health.</p>
            <p>We are particularly interested in individuals with a background in any of the following or related areas:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ZZZ</li>
              <li>YYY</li>

                <h4><strong>This is a fantastic opportunity to shape research efforts at the intersection of Cancer, Mental Health and the Microbiome!</strong> </h4>
                <p>We anticipate at least 100 people from diverse backgrounds will want to participate in this scoping workshop. After it is completed we will invite everyone to apply to participate in an Ideas Lab in November 2024 where we will develop research proposals to explore the challenges that are identified during the Scoping Workshop.</p>
                <p>By participating in the Scoping workshop you will help shape the research agenda in this space, meet colleagues who share your interest and develop relationships that might lead to future research projects.</p>

              Everything below will be the main content section.
              To add a new section:
              1. Add <h3> section for heading
              2. Add <p> section(s) for paragraphs of text
            -->
           
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>We need your help to identify the critical research questions that - if answered - would link how, through alterations/actions in the gut microbiome, medications and treatments influence behavioral and mental health in cancer patients.</p>
            
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The stress of a cancer diagnosis can impinge upon a patients’ physical and behavioral health, including changes of mental health such as the onset of depression and/or anxiety and substance use. These behavioral health issues can be exacerbated by side effects of cancer treatments, which can range from mild to severe, and often dramatically impact the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract. In the absence of cancer, changes in the microbiome, and their metabolites, are known to impact mental health through the gut-brain axis.
            <p>Because cancer treatments can alter the microbiome, there is likely a complex systemic interplay between cancer treatments, the gastrointestinal system, including the microbiome, and mental health. Therapeutic interventions are selected to target specific physiological problems. As more problems arise, additional pharmaceutical or therapeutic interventions are administered — some of which might be self-prescribed (such as over-the-counter supplements or cannabis products)— creating a complex “polypharmacy” state. These interventions may have unanticipated direct or indirect consequences on both mental health and the gut microbiome.</p>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute believes that patient outcomes could potentially be improved by understanding how better to manage polypharmacy in a cancer patient within the context of behavioral health issues, microbiome dysbiosis and symptom management. To achieve such improvements it is imperative to move beyond exploring relationships in a pair-wise manner and take systems approaches to understand the mechanistic relationships of the interplay among these complex elements together.</p>
            <p>At this stage we are <b>not</b> interested in solutions. We want to use this scoping workshop to identify the key research questions which - if answered - might create breakthrough progress at the intersection of these three fields. The questions might revolve around:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Interaction among multiple medications, the microbiome, and mental health in cancer patients</li>
              <li>How these interactions manifest in measurable ways and identify which interactions are actionable for maximal patient benefit</li>
              <li>How this understanding could inform clinical practice</li>
            </ul>
            
          
            <h3>The Event</h3>
            <p>This is a Scoping Workshop designed to identify what you consider to be the most interesting research questions and to build a community of interest at the intersection of these three fields.</p>
            <p>Everyone who participates in the Scoping workshop will be invited to apply to join an Ideas Lab during the week commencing November 11th 2024 where you will develop collaborative research proposals to explore the questions identified at the Scoping Workshop.</p>  
            <p>The event will be held <u>virtually</u> over two days on Tuesday August 27th and Wednesday 28th August. To accommodate as many people as possible, we will start at 1100 EST and run through until 1630 in three 90 minute sessions with a number of long breaks.</p>         

            <h3>How To Register</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute encourages applications from any party interested in actively participating in discussions and challenges about cancer, polypharmacy, the microbiome, and mental health.</p>

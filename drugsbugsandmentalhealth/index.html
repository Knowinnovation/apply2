      3. Press Ctrl+F and search "banner"
      4. Replace "banner.jpg" with the new image name in the following:
            background-image: url('../../images/banner.jpg');
      Note: keep the ../../images/ if the new image is stored in the images folder

      OR change the background image by deleting "banner.jpg" in the images folder and then upload a new image titled "banner.jpg" to the same location.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute seeks to engage in discussions to discern potential critical unaddressed questions that link how, via alterations/actions in the gut microbiome, medications and treatments influence behavioral and mental health in cancer patients.</p>
            <p>The stress of a cancer diagnosis can impinge upon a patients’ physical and behavioral health, including changes of mental health such as the onset of depression and/or anxiety and substance use. These behavioral health issues can be exacerbated by side effects of cancer treatments, which can range from mild to severe, and often dramatically impact the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract. In the absence of cancer, changes in the microbiome, and their metabolites, are known to impact mental health through the gut-brain axis. Because cancer treatments can alter the microbiome, there is likely a complex systemic interplay between cancer treatments, the gastrointestinal system, including the microbiome, and mental health. Therapeutic interventions are selected to target specific physiological problems. As more problems arise, additional pharmaceutical or therapeutic interventions are administered —some of which might be self-prescribed (such as over-the-counter supplements or cannabis products)— creating a complex “polypharmacy” state. These interventions may have unanticipated direct or indirect consequences on both mental health and the gut microbiome.</p>

            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute believes that patient outcomes could potentially be improved by understanding how best to manage polypharmacy in a cancer patient within the context of behavioral health issues, microbiome dysbiosis and symptom management. To achieve such improvements it is imperative to move beyond exploring relationships in a pair-wise manner and take systems approaches to understand the mechanistic relationships of the interplay among these complex elements together. To do this, we deem it necessary to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Understand the array of interactions among multiple medications, the microbiome, and mental health in cancer patients</li>
              <li>Understand how these interactions manifest in measurable ways and identify which interactions are actionable for maximal patient benefit</li>
              <li>Determine how this understanding could inform clinical practice</li>
            </ul>
            
          
            <h3>The Event</h3>
            <p>There is currently no framework within the National Cancer Institute to support projects that increase our understanding linking polypharmacy in a cancer patient within the context of behavioral health issues, microbiome dysbiosis and symptom management.</p>
            <p>This event is a scoping workshop designed to bring together, and actively engage, interested parties to challenge how to think about these complex relationships in a dynamic and testable manner. Individuals with diverse perspectives and expertise are encouraged to participate in this virtual event.</p>
            <p>The event will consist of three 90 minute activities</p>
         

            <h3>How To Register</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute encourages applications from any party interested in actively participating in discussions and challenges about cancer, polypharmacy, the microbiome, and mental health.</p>

             <!--<h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>We need your help to develop a systems level understanding of how cancer therapies or cancer itself interacts with the gut microbiome to alter or be altered by mental health?.</p>
            -->
            
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The stress of a cancer diagnosis can impinge upon a patient's physical and mental health and cognition, including the onset of depression and/or anxiety and substance use. These mental health issues can be exacerbated by side effects of cancer treatments, which can range from mild to severe, and often dramatically impact the gut microbiome. In the absence of cancer, changes in the microbiome called dysbiosis are known to impact mental health through the gut-brain axis.</p>
            <p>Because cancer treatments routinely adversely affect gut health, there is likely a systemic relationship between cancer treatments, the gastrointestinal system, including the microbiome, and mental health and cognition. Therapeutic interventions are selected to achieve a clinical outcome but, as more problems arise, additional pharmaceutical or therapeutic interventions are administered — some of which might be self-prescribed (such as over-the-counter supplements or cannabis products) — creating a complex “polypharmacy” state. These interventions may have unanticipated direct or indirect consequences on both mental health and the gut microbiome, altering the trajectory of patient outcomes.</p>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute seeks to develop an understanding at a systems level of how pharmacologic management of patients with cancer affects mental health and cognition through interactions with the gut microbiome.</p>
            <p>The Innovation Lab will identify and develop key research ideas that might create breakthroughs in terms of systems level understanding that might ultimately lead to improved outcomes in patients with cancer.</p>
            <p>We will encourage the formation of collaborative teams working at the nexus of the fields of Cancer, Mental Health, and the Microbiome.</p>
            
            <h3>The Event</h3>
            <p>The Innovation Lab is designed to identify research ideas that develop a systems level understanding of how pharmacologic management of patients with cancer affects mental health and cognition through interactions with the gut microbiome.</p>
            <p>At the same time we are keen to encourage the creation of interdisciplinary teams who might choose to collaborate at the intersection of Cancer, the Microbiome and Mental Health.</p>  
            <p>The Innovation Lab will be held over 4 days blah blah </p>         

            <h3>How To Apply</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute encourages applications from any party interested in actively participating in discussions and challenges about cancer, the microbiome, and mental health.</p>

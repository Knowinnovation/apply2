              1. Add <h3> section for heading

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Our nation increasingly faces the early and devastating impacts of climate change, including more severe wildfires, hurricanes, floods, droughts, and episodes of poor air quality. These impacts are inherently local, and effective solutions will require place-based, action-oriented research collaborations that include the communities in harmâ€™s way. </p>
            <p>To address this problem and work toward community resilience, the National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is exploring the concept of establishing a set of regional hubs across the U.S. These hubs, called NCAR Earth System Science and Technology hubs (NESTs), would be led by universities, supported by NCAR, and incorporate a wide range of local partners, including nonprofits, other academic institutions, government agencies, community groups, and private industry. These would address a challenging societal problem, or set of problems, that centers on climate change impacts relevant to their local community, with communities actively contributing toward developing ideas and effective solutions.</p>
            <P>NCAR is a federally funded research and development center based in Boulder, Colorado, and sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF). </P>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>We need your help! To ensure that the NESTs concept matures into a successful program that effectively serves local communities, enables local universities, and facilitates rich and productive partnerships across sectors, we need to gather your valuable feedback, expertise, and perspectives. In particular, we want to engage people from the kinds of organizations we envision being a part of NESTs, from nonprofit staff and government workers to university researchers and private industry representatives.</p>
            <p>Does this sound like you? If so, we encourage you to apply for one of our expense-paid upcoming workshops (details below). 
</p>
          
            <h3>About the Workshops</h3>
            <p>NCAR is holding a pair of community engagement workshops to co-evolve the NESTs concept with university, private, and public sector partners. </p>
            <p>The workshop goals include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Refining the NESTs concept and updating the vision by incorporating input from workshop participants

</li>
              <li>Articulating a clearly defined niche for the NESTs program</li>
              <li>Developing a report for the National Science Foundation that summarizes the community need, interest, and support for regional hubs, along with a plan for implementation
</li>
            </ul>

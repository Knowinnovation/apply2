            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The DARPA Information Innovation Office (I2O) will host “AI Forward,” an initiative to explore future
directions for AI. DARPA invites prospective attendees to apply to attend <a href="https://sam.gov/opp/7b8a5a90b61744b89d192687940a8ef9/view" target="blank">(see RFI here)</a>. As a part of the application,
individuals will be asked to submit an executive summary outlining a compelling research direction
toward trustworthy AI with applications for national security.</p>
            
            <h3> Challenge</h3>
            <p>In the past decade, we have seen impressive advances in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
particularly in data-driven machine-learning technologies. However, AI that functions with suitable
levels of trustworthiness for many national security applications does not yet exist. To be trusted, such
a system must reliably operate competently, interact appropriately with people, and meet pressing
national security needs in an ethical manner. Creating such systems will require significant advances in
(at least) three key areas:
            	<p><ul>
           <li> Foundational theory, to understand the art of the possible, bound the limits of particular system
instantiations, and inform guardrails for AI systems in challenging domains such as national
security;</li>
<li> AI engineering, to predictably build systems that work as intended in the real world and not just
in the lab; and</li>
<li> Human-AI teaming, to enable systems to serve as fluent, intuitive, trustworthy teammates to
people with various backgrounds.</li></ul>

<p>These thrusts emerged as important directions in the course of drafting DARPA’s current <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOrMZdyRlL0&list=PL6wMum5UsYvY2odwylYg81JoQhu3P7D1r&index=3" target="_blank">“AI Analytic Framework”</a> and are consistent with the  <a href="https://www.ai.gov/strategy-documents/" target="_blank">National AI R&D Strategic Priorities</a>. In addition, we need to dramatically improve the efficiency of machine-learning (ML), in terms of both data and compute, to
make ML-based systems cost-effective for many national security applications.</p>

            <h3>About the Workshops</h3>
            <p>AI Forward will consist of two workshops (one in-person and one virtual) in summer 2023. During these
highly interactive and collaborative workshops, participants will work together to envision new research
directions that could lead to trustworthy AI suitable for national security applications. Participation is
limited to approximately 100 people per workshop. Each workshop will include discussions and guided
brainstorming sessions with industry, academic, and government leaders and experts on current and
future research directions in AI. </p>
            <p>The workshops are intense, interactive, and free-thinking. They aim to stimulate thinking about
promising new research directions that span the many diverse domains of AI, including human language
technology, large language models, generative models, the philosophy and ethics of AI, and embodied
cognition with an eye to future national-security related applications. Participants will be expected to
engage constructively in dialogue with each other, the facilitators, and the Subject Guides (experts in the
field who will help to frame and guide discussions) to develop collaborative research themes to help
define possible future DARPA activities. The goal is to bring individuals from different disciplines
together to interact and engage in free-thinking on first principles, to learn from one another, and to
create an integrated vision for future research thematic areas. </p>
            <p>Through the course of the workshop, participants will form small groups, pitch and refine themes (based
on input from Subject Guides) for interdisciplinary topic areas that advance scientific questions about
the future of AI and how to solve the problem of capable, trustworthy AI that partners well with humans
in the context of challenging, real-world problems.</p>

<p>AI Forward will be facilitated by KnowInnovation, a company that specializes in working with science
groups to accelerate innovation and achieve strategic outcomes. Participants can expect highly
interactive virtual and in-person events. The majority of time will be spent in solution-focused
discussions after a few targeted plenary lectures designed to set the stage.</p>

            <h3>Event Outcomes</h3>

            <p>The ultimate output of the workshops will be the identification of approximately 40 promising areas for
future research. For each area, participants will explore items like open issues, potential research
questions, desired impact, and needed expertise to make progress. Participants will make a presentation
(2-3 minutes) for each area and provide a companion white paper (2-3 pages). DARPA will consider
these presentations and white papers in forming its AI strategy going forward. As a part of that strategy,
DARPA will likely create two (2) new <a href="https://www.darpa.mil//work-with-us/ai-next-campaign" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence Exploration projects (AIEs)</a> based on the outputs of the two AI Forward Workshops. </p>

<p>Participants will be able to submit their work for consideration to these AIEs, which will be announced broadly to solicit proposals.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Who Should Apply</h3>
            <p>Each workshop will bring together experts in AI Theory, Computer Vision, Human-Machine Symbiosis,
Knowledge Representation & Reasoning, Machine Learning, Meta-Cognition, Large Language Models,
Generative AI, Theory of Machine Learning, and more. It is anticipated that the interdisciplinary collaborations formed during these events will result in the identification of new and promising areas for
future research. Participants will explore each area for open issues, potential research questions,
desired impact, and needed expertise to make progress.</p>

<p>Organizers will select approximately 100 participants from the applicant pool for each workshop on the
basis of the interests, expertise, and other characteristics solicited in the application, including date and
format preference. Most participants are expected to be academic faculty or industry and government
researchers, however, original thinkers from outside academia, industry, and government are also
encouraged to apply. When selecting participants, organizers will strive to balance a range of diverse
disciplinary experience and expertise. All participants should be willing to engage in frank discussions
and assessment of ideas in a collegial and professional fashion. To facilitate open sharing, all meeting
discussions will be considered a private communication and not to be shared outside of the meeting,
unless approved by the contributor.</p>

<p>The solicitation and collection of personal information by the website host is solely for the purpose of
site administration, application tracking, communication with applicants, and to provide updates. Other
than for this use, personal information will not be maintained, used, stored, indexed, or retrieved from
any information system/database without your prior notice, choice, or consent. Personal information
will be safeguarded using appropriate physical, administrative, and technical protocols. </p>

<p>U.S. citizens and Foreign Nationals (FNs) are welcome to apply. All FNs who are invited to attend the virtual or in-person event must complete either a) a DARPA Form 60 (for academia, industry, or individual researchers, only) or b) an Official Visit Request which is  generated and submitted by the respective country’s Embassy (for government organizations, only) beforehand. </p>
 
       
            <h3>How to Apply</h3>

Please also be prepared to provide an executive summary outlining a compelling research direction towards trustworthy AI for national security. You may apply to either the virtual or in-person format.</p>

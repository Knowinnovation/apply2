            <p>The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has launched two <i>Requests for Applications</i> (RFA) for grant opportunities that will fund collaborative teams bringing together patient-led rare disease organizations and research teams for 4-year research projects aimed at advancing our understanding of the fundamental science of rare diseases. Applications are being accepted for two funding opportunities:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Patient-Partnered Collaborations for Rare Neurodegenerative Disease:</strong> to advance the understanding of the biological mechanisms of rare neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/patient-partnered-collaborations-ppc-for-rare-neurodegenerative-disease/" target="_blank">Learn more about this RFA.</a></li>
              <li><strong>Patient-Partnered Collaborations for Single-Cell Analysis of Rare Inflammatory Pediatric Disease:</strong> to support the application of single-cell biology methods to rare inflammatory pediatric diseases. <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/patient-partnered-collaborations-ppc-for-single-cell-analysis-of-rare-inflammatory-pediatric-disease/" target="_blank">Learn more about this RFA.</a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Together, these RFAs aim to support patient-centered, foundational science-focused projects that seek to characterize the cellular mechanisms underlying rare diseases. For many rare and ultra-rare disorders, even when there is a diagnosis, the lack of understanding of disease biology is a critical bottleneck for developing treatments. Each of these funding opportunities recognizes patient-led organizations as central to connecting researchers and the patient community, defining research questions and priorities, contributing to study design and execution, supporting outreach, disseminating study results and more. These RFAs are open to either existing patient-organization and researcher collaborative teams or to new collaborations. We are particularly encouraging of researchers and organizations who are looking to develop new collaborations and to researchers and organizations representing disease areas where there are health inequities.</p>
            <p><strong>Join us on <i>Wednesday, February 16th, from 9am-10:30am Pacific Time</i> for a webinar Information Session</strong> to learn more about both RFAs: Patient-Partnered Collaborations for Rare Neurodegenerative Disease and Patient-Partnered Collaborations for Single-Cell Analysis of Rare Inflammatory Pediatric Disease. </p>
            <p>In follow-up to the Information Session, we will be providing <strong>a three-part series of targeted networking workshops for the Patient-Partnered Collaborations for Rare Neurodegenerative Disease RFA</strong>. These will be webinar-based events where you will have a chance to engage with other groups and potential collaborators. The goals of these Networking Workshops are to provide opportunities for researchers and patient groups with interests in neurodegenerative disease to connect with each other and potentially form collaborations and project teams  for application to this RFA. </p>
            <p>Advance registration for all events is required (see below). </p>
            <p><i>Please note that we will not be hosting similar events related to the Patient-Partnered Collaborations for Single-Cell Analysis of Rare Inflammatory Pediatric Disease RFA.</i></p>

            <h3>The Rare Neurodegenerative Disease Engagement Workshop Series</h3>
            <p>Below you will find more information about the Workshop series and what to expect from each of the three sessions. This series of networking events and workshops aims to catalyze new collaborations between patient research organizations and researchers, and to bring together existing teams interested in applying to the Patient-Partnered Collaborations for Rare Neurodegenerative Disease RFA. Registration is required and in some cases, space will be limited. You may register for sessions depending on your interest. It is not necessary to participate in all three sessions. All sessions will be virtual. Note that participation in these Workshops is not required for application to the RFAs and priority will not be given to those who attend the workshops. </p>

            <h3>What can I expect from the Networking Workshops and Expo? What are the expectations from participants?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>A goal of this interactive format is to provide opportunities for participants to actively engage with each other, to explore ideas and potential opportunities for collaboration, and where appropriate, plan for an application to the Patient-Partnered Collaborations (PPC) for Rare Neurodegenerative Disease RFA.</li>
              <li>All events will be hosted virtually and include an online web platform where participants can register, find one another and network with each other. Live sessions will be held using the Zoom platform. </li>
              <li>Advance application is required for all sessions, and participants will be selected based on their application.</li>
              <li>All participants should be willing to engage in frank discussion and assessment of ideas in a collegial and professional fashion (see Community Participation Guidelines below). </li>
            </ul>
            

            <strong>Networking Workshops (Sessions I and II)</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>The two 120-minute Networking Workshops are intended to bring patient groups and researchers together.</li>
              <li>Participants will hear examples of what successful patient-partnered research collaborations might look like, how to maintain successful partnerships, and what key factors can contribute to success.</li>
              <li>The Networking Workshop (Sessions I and I) will lead with panel discussions from existing patient groups and researchers and will be followed by small-group interactive networking/discussion groups. Here, participants will engage with each other, meet in small groups, and share their perspectives.</li>
              <li>The panel discussions will be recorded and made available on this website for anyone interested to view them after the event. The content of the Networking/Discussion groups will be closed and not be shared publicly.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <strong>Networking Expo</strong>

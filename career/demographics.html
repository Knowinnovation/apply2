<p>The Federal Government has a continuing commitment to monitor the operation of its review and award processes and to identify and address any inequities based on gender, race, ethnicity, or disability of its proposed PIs/PDs. The National Science Foundation is committed to broadening the participation of groups currently underrepresented in science and engineering. In order to accurately gauge progress in achieving this important goal, we ask that proposers provide the requested demographic information about themselves as part of your account profile. Submission of the requested information is voluntary and is not a precondition of selection. Nonetheless, we need your cooperation, for information not submitted will seriously undermine the statistical validity, and therefore the usefulness, of information we get from others.</p>
<p>Collection of this information is authorized by the NSF Act of 1950, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 1861, et seq. Demographic data allows NSF to gauge whether our programs and other opportunities in science and technology are fairly reaching and benefiting everyone regardless of demographic category; to ensure that those in under-represented groups have the same knowledge of and access to programs, meetings, vacancies, and other research and educational opportunities as everyone else. The information will be held closely. It may be disclosed to government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers to complete assigned work; and to other government agencies needing the information in order to conduct joint merit reviews with NSF; See Systems of Records, NSF-51, “Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records, ” 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004).

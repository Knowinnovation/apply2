      1. Add new image to ../../images/ folder
      2. Open main.css
      3. Press Ctrl+F and search "banner"
      4. Replace "banner.jpg" with the new image name in the following:
            background-image: url('../../images/banner.jpg');
      Note: keep the ../../images/ if the new image is stored in the images folder

      OR change the background image by deleting "banner.jpg" in the images folder and then upload a new image titled "banner.jpg" to the same location.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Biomedical research is typically planned and conducted in silos in areas such as clinical care, genomic sequencing, research repositories, and computational resources, that impede the effective sharing, discovery, and utilization of health-derived data. Despite advances in individual data domains, the absence of standardized technical infrastructure, common data semantics, and interoperability protocols across these silos and between different stages of the data lifecycle, prevents researchers from integrating heterogeneous data sources. In turn, this limits reproducibility and rigor in analysis, and creates unnecessary barriers to translating research insights into clinical practice and policy action.</p> 

<p>Vertical interoperability between research tools used in every stage of the research lifecycle can overcome the siloed nature of much current research, and enable seamless passage of data and metadata throughout the lifecycle, from the initial stages of research planning to the archiving and deposit of research output. </p>  
<p>By enabling research tools used at every stage of the lifecycle to communicate and exchange structured data and metadata, vertical interoperability allows seamless passage of information from study design and data capture through analysis, repository deposit, and long-term archiving.</p> 
<p><b>The Vertical Interoperability Innovation Lab will develop and propose concept workflows that adopt vertical interoperability and bridge these first- and last-mile data connectivity gaps, enabling federated biomedical research infrastructure across the data lifecycle. </b>  In so doing,+ the proposed workflows will help to sustain NIH's commitment to data/metadata sharing, enhance human-derived data utility for science, and strengthen the capacity of the biomedical research community to conduct rigorous, reproducible, and transparent health-focused research.</p>             
         
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            
            <h3>About the Workshop</h3>
           <p>
    The Vertical Interoperability Innovation Lab is a highly interactive, 
    collaborative working session designed to generate actionable research proposals.
  </p>
  <p> Participation is limited to approximately <strong>30 participants</strong>.</p>
            <p>The workshop will include:</p>
             <ul>
    <li>Guided discussions</li>
    <li>Structured brainstorming</li>
    <li>Small-group collaboration</li>
    <li>Rapid project development and refinement</li>
    <li>Input from Subject Guides (field experts who frame and challenge ideas)</li>
  </ul>
            <p>Participants will work together to:</p>
             <ul>
    <li>Envision future research directions in vertical interoperability</li>
    <li>Develop interdisciplinary proposal teams</li>
    <li>Pitch and refine concept workflows</li>
    <li>Identify promising pathways for future activity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The workshops are intense, interactive, and future-oriented. They bring together individuals from different disciplines to engage in first-principles thinking and collaborative design.
</p>
            <p>This workshop will be facilitated by Knowinnovation, specialists in accelerating scientific innovation and guiding high-impact research communities toward strategic outcomes.
</p>
            <p>Participants can expect a highly interactive virtual event, with the majority of time devoted to small group, solution-focused dialogue and collaborative development.</p>

            <h3>Who Should Apply?</h3>

              <h4>What to expect</h4>
              <p>Our interdisciplinary, virtual event series will assemble a group of scientists, industry experts, and government agencies to develop approaches to unlock the power of open data to solve important societal challenges.</p>
              <p>There will be no lengthy keynotes or panels, no symposia or poster sessions. This will be an immersive, dynamic event in which you'll be intellectually and creatively challenged while you generate, explore, and develop unique, ambitious concepts. The end goal is a <strong>roadmap</strong> that describes the opportunities - problems that can be solved with an open knowledge network - and challenges - the path to get there!</p>
              <p>The event series will be facilitated by Knowinnovation.</p>

            <h4>Join a 4-month virtual event series, or lend your input...</h4>
            <p><strong>Read on to learn more, and take our survey to indicate your interest in participating!</strong></p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>OKN, the open knowledge network, is a concept that envisions connecting many public, government, and other open datasets into one large connected information infrastructure. The benefit of creating this infrastructure is that government agencies, private organizations, academics, and anyone can better access and utilize open data to drive evidence-based policies, develop novel AI capabilities, and tackle societal problems.</p>
            <p style="font-weight:bold;">The focus of the OKN innovation sprint is to construct a roadmap to a prototype OKN  through the development of compelling use cases to illustrate what might be possible with a fully functional open knowledge network.</p>
            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <p><strong>The project is currently open for input and participants. Scroll to the bottom and click the link to take our survey and indicate your interest to get involved.</strong></p>
            <p>In the first phase, participating scientists, government agencies, and industry representatives will form teams and design use cases.</p>
            <p>In the second phase, groups will dive deeper into those use cases to develop road maps to support the realization of the use case through an open knowledge network.</p>
            <p>In the third phase, groups will present their work and develop concepts for integrating the use cases as foundational components of a prototype open knowledge network.</p>
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Large knowledge structures with natural language query interfaces will enable new modes of data-driven discovery with the potential to impact science, education, business, and society in a manner comparable to the world wide web. Knowledge graphs are already widely used in industry for consumer services and enterprise applications, but are proprietary systems. To enable the maximum benefit to society, this sprint will lay the foundation for a nonproprietary shared knowledge infrastructure. To ensure impact, use cases will be built based on government agency data priorities and building on existing data infrastructures, but identifying challenges that can best be solved with integration of multiple data sets managed by multiple organizations.</p>

            <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
            <p>This project will require input from a broad collection of scientific disciplines, as well as input from  government agencies that publish and use open data (which is nearly all of them).</p>
            <p>In addition to academic and government participants, industry partners are key stakeholders, given their expertise and experience, as well as their position as users of a possible future open knowledge network.</p>
            <h3>The Opportunity</h3>
            <p>This event series is unlike your typical top-down speaker/panel dominated conferences.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Participants will learn from collaborations across sectors and disciplines.</li>
              <li>The project is interested in real problems and novel solutions.</li>
              <li>This is a chance to shape the development of how a major technological resource develops.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Meeting Outcomes</h3>
            <p>The work done will produce an integrated report, outlining key opportunities and challenges and possible next steps to establish the prototype of  an open knowledge network.</p>

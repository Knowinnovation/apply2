      To change the background image:
      1. Add new image to ../../images/ folder
      2. Open main.css
      3. Press Ctrl+F and search "banner"
      4. Replace "banner.jpg" with the new image name in the following:
            background-image: url('../../images/banner.jpg');
      Note: keep the ../../images/ if the new image is stored in the images folder

      OR change the background image by deleting "banner.jpg" in the images folder and then upload a new image titled "banner.jpg" to the same location.

              2. Add <p> section(s) for paragraphs of text
            -->
           
            <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
            <p>The Exobiology research program in NASAâ€™s Planetary Science Division solicits research regarding biosignatures - as defined in the call:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Biosignature studies, including research focused on defining, understanding, or characterizing biosignatures in samples from Earth sites thought to be analogues of other planetary environments that might potentially harbor life will be considered as part of NASA's broader interest in the search for life in the Universe.</li>
              </ul>
            
            
            <h3><b>The Challenge</b></h3>
            <p>As highlighted in <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/planetary-science-and-astrobiologydecadal-survey-2023-2032">Origins, Worlds, and Life: A Decadal Strategy for Planetary Science and Astrobiology 2023-2032</a>, research that has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of new, unambiguous biosignatures to accelerate our efforts towards the search for life is of particular interest to the Astrobiology Program. We are interested in working beyond traditional methods and looking for the next generation of biosignatures - particularly going back to fundamentals to identify ways that different types of biosignatures can work together to provide a more robust assessment. We would like to see the attendees work in teams to identify new potential biosignatures and research directions to verify the applicability of these biosignatures.</p>
            
              
            <h3><b>Workshop Format + Outcomes</b></h3>
            <h5><b>FORMAT</b></h5>
            <p>This event is designed as a hybrid experience, encompassing virtual pre-meetings, followed by three days of in-person sessions, and concluding with three full-day virtual sessions.
            </p>
            <h5><b>OUTCOMES</b></h5>
            <p>We expect to select for funding (~3) proposals - that would meet the Exobiology program requirements - produced as a result of this process.</p>
           <hr>
           <h3><b>Who Should Apply</b></h3>
           <p>If you are a scientist at a US institution who is passionate about the search for life beyond Earth, interested in biosignature research, and eager to collaborate in interdisciplinary teams to discover and innovate in the field of biosignatures, we invite you to submit an application.</p>
           <p>When applying, please be prepared to provide information about your qualifications, your research focus, and why you are interested in and qualified for the NASA Ideas Lab: Biosignatures. Applications will be reviewed by our selection committee, and all personal information will be kept confidential.</p>

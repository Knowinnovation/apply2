    <h3><b>What is an Ideation Factory?</b></h3>
            <p>Astrobiology Mission Ideation Factories are intensive and interactive workshops focused on developing creative ideas for future life detection missions. These workshops are held for two weeks spread out over two years, and bring together 25-30 early career scientists from a broad range of disciplines to produce radically innovative research proposals that address the biggest questions in astrobiology.

During the workshops, participants engage with their colleagues in a creative, free-thinking environment - away from their everyday routines and responsibilities - immersing themselves in a collaborative process developing their own life detection missions. Over the course of the workshops, participants are part of a multidisciplinary group of scientists who work to build a shared understanding of the unique challenges faced by their mission goals, define what their most important research questions are, and generate novel ideas to address these burning science questions.<p>

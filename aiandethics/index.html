                <p>The National Institutes of Health’s Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS) seeks to build a multi-disciplinary community of stakeholders interested in the social implications of technology to collaboratively envision the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and ethics in biomedicine to advance the NIH mission. The overarching goal is to bring together a diverse cross-section of scientists, social scientists, ethicists, patient advocates, legal scholars, communicators, and artists to identify important areas of consideration and problem-solving strategies at the intersection of AI, machine learning (ML), biomedical and behavioral sciences, and ethics.

            <h3>Micro Lab #1</h3>
            <p><strong><i>Wednesday Dec 15th, 2021, 2-4pm EST</i></strong></p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are a collection of data-driven approaches with the potential to significantly advance scientific research but that also have the potential to hinder social justice and equity. Therefore, a strategic and thoughtful approach is needed to promote the ethical use of AI in research to minimize harm while generating knowledge for the benefit of all of society.</p>
            <p>The NIH Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS) seeks to draw on diverse perspectives and expertise to identify important areas of consideration at the intersection of AI/ML, biomedical and behavioral sciences, and ethics. The purpose of this Micro Lab is to identify the relevant stakeholders and contributors to further discussion about the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI/ML in biomedicine to advance NIH mission goals, including addressing the impacts of these technologies on disadvantaged or marginalized groups and health disparities. In this Micro Lab, a broad selection of participants will engage in interactive discussions to help shape the conversation about AI/ML ethics in the biomedical and behavioral sciences at the NIH. </p>
            <p>This first Micro Lab will build towards a second Micro Lab hosted by ODSS. Participants from Micro Lab 1 are welcome to register and participate in Micro Lab 2.</p>

            <p>The NIH Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS) seeks to draw on diverse perspectives and convene experts in AI/ML, biomedical and behavioral sciences, and ethics to identify problem solving strategies and future directions in biomedical AI/ML that align with NIH’s goals with respect to the public interest, research, and health equity.  In this Micro Lab, an expanded community of participants from cross-disciplinary backgrounds will address questions that are exciting, innovative, and far-reaching to imagine the future opportunities and challenges in biomedical AI ethics.</p>
            <p>Individuals interested in attending Micro Lab 2 need not have attended Micro Lab 1. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Who Should Attend</h3>

            </ol>
            <p>If you have a stake in who benefits from understanding and using AI and ML in biomedical and behavioral sciences, are interested in addressing health equity or the responsible and ethical use of AI technology, or you are a critical and creative thinker who enjoys problem solving with others and considering diverse perspectives and approaches, then please consider applying for this opportunity. Please be prepared to answer questions about yourself, your work and collaboration experiences, your research focus, and your interest in the Micro Lab. Applications will be reviewed internally and submitted information will be kept secure to the extent permitted by law. Please share this information with any colleagues you think may be interested.</p>
            <p>The NIH welcomes early-career stage researchers and fellows, including post-docs; experts in industry, government, or the non-profit space who are interested in the social implications of technology; filmmakers, novelists, artists, or individuals from other creative fields who explore the intersection of society and technology to apply. We are most interested in novel and innovative ideas that arise from new collaborations among people of diverse backgrounds, expertise, and approaches. All participants should be willing to actively engage in interdisciplinary discussion and collaborate in a collegial and professional manner. To facilitate open sharing, all meeting discussions will be considered a private communication not to be shared outside of the meeting unless approved by the contributor. </p>

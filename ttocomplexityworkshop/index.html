            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In our day to day lives we are hearing more about quantum computing and how it can fundamentally change how we process information, opening the door to processing information faster in completely new ways, or tackling up until now impossible to solve research questions. At this innovation lab, participants will work together, across disciplines to begin to conceptualize “now” possible real-world medical problems, like novel treatments for cancer.</p>

<p>Quantum computing is a cutting-edge computational paradigm that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics. This approach has the potential to introduce new computational methods capable of overcoming persistent hurdles to progress in biomedical research, providing new avenues for the study of complex biological questions. Biomedical data science integrates principles and techniques from computer science, statistics, mathematics, biology and medicine to extract meaningful insights and knowledge in order to advance our understanding of diseases (for example cancer), developing new treatments, and improving healthcare delivery. This field of science is critical to supporting advances in basic through clinical biomedical research, especially given the ever-increasing scale of data being collected as a result of rapidly advancing technologies and ever-expanding appreciation for the complexity of human biology relevant to disease development and progression.</p>

            </p>
            

<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>Quantum computing opens the door to new ways of thinking about biomedical research problems and new avenues of research. The challenge to participants is to brainstorm opportunities for research that prompt the development of quantum algorithms that address biomedical problems  (e.g., cancer research) with a clear plan for simulating a demonstration of a quantum advantage for the novel approach over classical approaches to the same problem.</p>
<p>Through advances in quantum computing we can leverage the power and potential to today’s biomedical research problems. </p>
<ul><li>What are the research questions that are uniquely suited to quantum computing?</li>
<li>How could quantum computing open a new frontier for biomedical research?</li>
<li>How can quantum computing change how we process medical imaging and diagnostics?</li>
<li>Can we identify and design new drugs using quantum computing?</li>
<li>Can we gain new insights analyzing DNA sequence information using quantum algorithms?</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge, then, is to combine the expertise of diverse scientists and quantum experts who are unlikely to have worked together in the past to identify those biomedical and cancer research problems for which relevant real-world data exists and for which quantum algorithms can be adapted and optimized to address the problem.

</p>
<h3>About the Event</h3>
<p>An Innovation Lab is an immersive, interactive experience. If selected, you will join a highly interdisciplinary group selected, in part, based on a low likelihood for prior interaction in a process designed to catalyze creative thinking.</p>
<p>From December 2-6, 2024, participants will engage with each other, their event facilitators, and expert guides to develop a shared understanding of the research challenge, explore novel solutions, and generate teams to shape these ideas into research proposals. Each day will build on the previous one as we develop and share novel approaches and new collaborations.
On the final day teams will present their research proposal concepts for the opportunity to <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=bqcc" target="_blank">win one of up to five challenge prizes totaling $100,000</a>. </p>

                  
                  <h3>Who Should Apply?</h3>
            <p>If you are eager to engage with diverse researchers to spark creative paths forward to advance the use of quantum computing to tackle real-world biomedical research problems and advance fields such as cancer research, join us! We encourage individuals with interest and expertise in a variety of fields, including but not limited to the following:</p>

<p>Quantum Computing, Quantum Physics, Systems Biology, Biomedical Informatics, Applied Mathematics, AI/Machine Learning, Cancer Biology, Applied Physics, Computer Science, Engineering, Clinical Medicine, Biomedical Data Science, Biostatistics, Pharmaceutics, Biomedical Imaging, and other relevant fields.</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>How to Apply</h3>
            <p>Space is limited so be sure to apply early! In-person attendance for the entirety of the workshop is expected to ensure a productive, results driven event. Participants will work to establish priority question(s) and research proposal concepts in this hands-on workshop.</p>

<p>The Innovation Lab will take place in-person in the Pacific Northwest. If selected to participate, your travel will be arranged and paid for by the National Institutes of Health. Only individuals that participate in teams at this event are eligible to receive one of the up to five challenge prizes.</p>

          <h3>Event Outcomes</h3>
          <p>The innovation lab is expected to yield insights and meaningful outcomes for developing quantum computing applications for biomedical research. Multidisciplinary teams will be formed, bringing together experts from quantum computing, bioinformatics, and biomedical research fields. These teams are anticipated to foster new collaborations between academic institutions, tech companies, and healthcare organizations, creating a foundation for continued  arrangement for future innovations.</p>

<p>Key achievements for this event will be the generation of feasible, short-term quantum computing use cases for biomedical research. The proposed use cases are expected to address critical challenges in the field, leveraging quantum computing’s unique capabilities to accelerate complex biomedical computations or simulations. The teams will aim to demonstrate how quantum computing technologies can significantly enhance current research methodologies, potentially leading to breakthroughs in areas such as biological sequence analysis, imaging diagnosis, or drug discovery. The innovative approach is expected to show promise in reducing time and resource requirements for important biomedical research workflows.  </p>

<p>The use cases developed during the innovation lab will be formally presented at the event’s conclusion. Each presentation will be accompanied by a short report documenting the use case scenario, detailing the applicable quantum technologies (e.g., computing, algorithm), and analyzing the expected impact compared to traditional computational workflows. These presentations and accompanying documentation will play a crucial role in the evaluation process for challenge awards. The quality, innovation, and potential impact of each use case, as demonstrated through both the presentation and the written report, will be key factors in determining the recipient teams of these awards.</p>

                <p><strong>If you have an opinion on this challenge, we want to hear from you.</strong> </p>
                <p>The challenge of communicating evolving information is not specific to cancer. We are looking for people with experience researching or communicating about evolving information across disciplines and content areas. We would also like to hear from social scientists, science communicators, clinicians, and patient advocates, and others who care passionately about how we might better communicate evolving cancer information. Participants will have the opportunity to interact with multidisciplinary colleagues, get feedback on new ideas, develop new collaborations, and <u>compete for prize awards of up to $10,000</u> to continue developing pilot research ideas.</p>
                <p>The application process is designed to encourage diversity. Participants will be selected to create the optimum mix of experience and expertise to spur creative thinking.</p>

              1. Add <h3> section for heading
              2. Add <p> section(s) for paragraphs of text

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute launched the Creative Collaborations Foundry in 2023 to spur innovative solutions to intractable problems in cancer control. The Foundryâ€™s Innovation Labs aim to accelerate progress by bringing together collaborative and open-minded people with diverse experiences, expertise, and perspectives.</p>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p><i>Changing guidelines about when women should start yearly mammography screening.</i></p>
            <p><i>Disagreement among researchers, healthcare providers, and private companies about the benefits that new multi-cancer early detection tests offer to current patients.</i></p>
            <p><i>Changes in protection of the rights, welfare and wellbeing of all human subjects involved in clinical research human subjects</i></p>
            <p>We know that changing health information can lead to confusion, mistrust, disengagement, and difficulty making health decisions. In part, these consequences result from a failure to convey the nature of information and scientific discovery, leaving many poorly prepared to interpret and use new information to make health decisions.</p>
            <p>Practices and guidelines will continue to change as we learn and interpret new information. Innovative strategies are needed to prepare communicators and the public to deal with evolving information when it inevitably arises. We need proactive solutions that foster a realistic public understanding of the values and limits of information to prevent future changes from eroding trust and confidence and to prepare individuals to use new information to make the best health decisions for themselves.  </p>
          
            <h3>The Goals</h3>
            <p>We believe that solutions to this challenge are likely to exist at the interface between fields of expertise and lived experience, which is why we want to bring together a diverse community of people who bring different perspectives to the challenge. The goals of this innovation lab are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to form an interdisciplinary community of scholars,</li>
              <li>to nurture new collaborative teams,</li>
              <li>to pilot projects for subsequent submission to existing NCI funding opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What to expect</h3>
            <p>The Innovation Lab is an immersive, interactive experience. You will join a highly interdisciplinary group selected, in part, based on a low likelihood for prior interaction in a process designed to catalyze creative thinking. </p>
            <p>From July 15-19, participants will engage with each other, their event facilitators, and expert mentors to develop a shared understanding of the research challenge, explore novel solutions, and generate teams to shape these ideas into research proposals. Each day will build on the previous one as we develop and share novel approaches and new collaborations.</p>
            <p>On July 26, teams will present their research ideas for the opportunity to win one of 5 $10,000 challenge prizes, which are intended to facilitate further development of research collaborations and grant proposals for submission for NIH funding.</p>

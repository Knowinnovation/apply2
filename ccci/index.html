                <h4><strong>Important Dates: The week of July 15th - 19th 2024 inclusive and Friday, July 26th 2024 for final presentations.</strong> </h4>
                <p>We invite you to participate on all of the 5 days plus the final presentation day, and make yourself available to work in small teams outside these dates. We appreciate that this is a significant commitment but each day will build on the previous one as we develop and share novel approaches and new collaborations.</p>

                <h4><strong>If you have an opinion on this challenge, we want to hear from you.</strong> </h4>
                <p>The challenge of communicating conflicting and changing information is not specific to cancer—we are looking for people with experience researching or communicating about conflicting and changing information across disciplines and content areas. We would also like to hear from social scientists, science communicators, clinicians, and patient advocates, and others who care passionately about how we might better communicate conflicting cancer information. Participants will have the opportunity to interact with multidisciplinary colleagues, get feedback on new ideas, develop new collaborations, and compete for prize awards</p>
                <p>The application process is designed to encourage diversity. Participants will be selected to create the optimum mix of experience and expertise to spur creative thinking.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute launched the Creative Collaborations Foundry in 2023 to spur innovative solutions to intractable problems in cancer control. The Foundry’s Innovation Labs aim to accelerate progress by bringing together collaborative and open-minded people with diverse experiences, expertise, and perspectives.</p>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p><i>Changing guidelines about when women should start yearly mammography screening.</i></p>
            <p><i>Disagreement among researchers, healthcare providers, and private companies about the benefits that new multi-cancer early detection tests offer to current patients.</i></p>
            <p><i>Changes in protection of the rights, welfare and wellbeing of all human subjects involved in clinical research human subjects.</i></p>
            <p>We know that conflicting and changing health messages can lead to confusion, mistrust, disengagement, and difficulty making health decisions. In part, these consequences result from a failure to convey the nature of information and scientific discovery, leaving many poorly prepared to interpret and use new information to make health decisions.</p>
            <p>Practices and guidelines will continue to change as we learn and interpret new information. Innovative strategies are needed to prepare communicators and the public to deal with conflicting information when it inevitably arises. We need proactive solutions that foster a realistic public understanding of the values and limits of information to prevent future changes from eroding trust and confidence and to prepare individuals to use new information to make the best health decisions for themselves.  </p>
          
            <h3>The Event</h3>
            <p>We believe that solutions to this challenge are likely to exist at the interface between fields of expertise and lived experience, which is why we want to bring together a diverse community of people who bring different perspectives to the challenge. The goals of this innovation lab are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to form an interdisciplinary community of scholars,</li>
              <li>to nurture new collaborative teams,</li>
              <li>to pilot projects for subsequent submission to existing NCI funding opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What to expect</h3>
            <p>The Innovation Lab is an immersive, interactive, experience. You will join a highly interdisciplinary group selected, in part, based on a low likelihood for prior interaction in a process designed to catalyze creative thinking. </p>
            <p>The Innovation Lab includes 5 days of virtual meetings spread across a two-week period to allow participants time to reflect and to continue their work in small teams to further develop pilot research ideas. Participants will engage with each other, their event facilitators, and expert mentors to develop a shared understanding of the research challenge, explore novel solutions, and generate teams to shape these ideas into research proposals.</p>
            <p>On the final day, teams will present their research ideas for the opportunity to win one of 5 $10,000 challenge prizes, which are intended to facilitate further development of research collaborations and grant proposals for submission for NIH funding.</p>
            
            <h3>How To Apply</h3>
            <p>Applications are welcome from across a range of academic, industry, and community sectors. The Foundry invites online applications from eligible individuals using the application form. The submission deadline is XX.</p>

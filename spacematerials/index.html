            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Given the increasing military, scientific, and commercial use of Earth orbital and cislunar space, combined with the inexorable desire of humans to explore farther regions of the solar system, the need for new materials that can withstand harsh space environments will continue unabated. However, the more distant destinations mean that assurance in materials use based largely on heritage data or flight testing will become more limited and therefore more challenging. Thus, high-fidelity, ground-based experimental and modeling efforts that can guide materials design and predict performance will become ever more valuable. While numerous roadmaps to space and decadal surveys are being proposed, little attention is being paid to the materials themselves that will be required to function in relevant space environments. To help ensure that materials technology can meet future needs, this virtual workshop will gather experts in materials science, space environmental effects, spacecraft engineering, and mission planning to identify current and future needs for materials that will enable increased space exploration across widely varying various space environments.  This body of experts will also help to identify fundamental materials research areas where investment is likely to have the greatest impact on current and future needs.</p>

            <h3> Challenge</h3>
            <p>The U.S. and other countries have launched significant efforts to accelerate our understanding, qualification, and use of materials on a national and global scale (e.g. <a href= "https://www.mgi.gov/" target="-blank">https://www.mgi.gov/</a>, <a href="https://www.ami2030.eu/" target="_blank">https://www.ami2030.eu/</a>). However, materials research aimed specifically at the development of space-worthy and space-durable materials suitable for the harsh environments of space has languished. As physical testing of candidate materials at scale, in space, and over the lifetimes needed is both impractical and unreasonable, a new paradigm for materials investigation, development, and qualification is needed. Fortuitously, advances in accelerated testing, computational modeling, and our understanding of lunar and cislunar environments have all accelerated significantly over the past several decades. As a result, there currently exists a unique opportunity to bring together the “best-in-class”, in terms of understanding and tools, across academic, government, and international sectors. Not since the workshops that followed the return of Long Duration Exposure Facility 30 years ago have researchers from disparate materials science and space environmental effects communities attempted to identify areas of critical materials needs for future space operations. Commensurate with our ability to dream up a future of human expansion into space, we must ensure that materials technology can meet future needs. This workshop will help to ensure that this challenge is met.

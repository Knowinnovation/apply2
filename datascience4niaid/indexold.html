            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is excited to advance discovery and innovation in infectious diseases and immune-mediated disorders research by leveraging data and data science approaches. Towards this end, NIAID will conduct a series of ideas and innovation webinars that bring together experts and stakeholders in data science, infectious disease, immunology, and immune-mediated disorders.</p> 

            <p>Through the webinar series, participants will have the opportunity to provide insights into the current landscape of data science research and development, as well as offer ideas that promise to shape the future of data-driven immune-mediated and infectious disease research. The webinar series will serve as a platform for collaboration, idea generation, and networking among participants and generate foundational materials that is expected to inform the prospective role of data science in advancing NIAID’s mission.</p> 
            
            <h3>Join the Conversation</h3>
            <p>The organizers have created a website that allows participants to share ideas about how data science will transform infectious disease and immunological research ten years in the future. We encourage everyone to join the conversation and share their thoughts. To login, please click the button below.</p>

            <h3>Upcoming Workshop Events</h3>
            <h4>Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of Harnessing Data to Advance Immune-Mediated and Infectious Disease Research</h4>
<p>April 16th, 2021 2:00 p.m. – 3:30 p.m. (ET/America NYC)</p>
<p>The power of data has the potential to transform immune-mediated and infectious disease research.  Realizing this potential will necessarily involve careful consideration of bioethical concerns at scale: from issues affecting individual patients and their families to those affecting diverse communities around the globe.  The aim of this webinar is to navigate the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of data science as recent and future innovations shape immune-mediated and infectious disease research.</p>
<p>This is the second event in the Virtual Workshop Series for Harnessing the Power of Data to Advance Immune-mediated and Infectious Disease Research. During the webinar, our expert panel will bring each of the three ELSI perspectives into sharp focus for the immune-mediated and infectious disease research community to consider and respond.</p>

  <details><summary style="font-size:large;">Harnessing the Power of Data for Immune-Mediated and Infectious Disease Research - An Expert Panel Discussion (<i>Recorded on February 26th, 12:00-1:30 ET</i>)</summary>
  <p>This event was the first in the series activities that are intended to initiate discussions on provocative and untapped research topics at the intersection of biomedical data science and immune-mediated and infectious diseases. </p>
  <p>Our expert panel engaged in a moderated discussion following short talks where they highlighted the current landscape, future challenges, and the potential of data science within NIAID’s primary mission to conduct and support basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases.</p>

				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is excited to advance discovery and innovation in infectious diseases and immune-mediated disorders research by leveraging data and data science approaches. Towards this end, NIAID will conduct a series of ideas and innovation webinars that bring together experts and stakeholders in data science, infectious disease, immunology, and immune-mediated disorders.</p> 

				<p>Through the webinar series, participants will have the opportunity to provide insights into the current landscape of data science research and development, as well as offer ideas that promise to shape the future of data-driven immune-mediated and infectious disease research. The webinar series will serve as a platform for collaboration, idea generation, and networking among participants and generate foundational materials that is expected to inform the prospective role of data science in advancing NIAID’s mission.</p> 
				<h3>Join the Conversation</h3>
				<p>The organizers have created a website that allows participants to share ideas about how data science will transform infectious disease and immunological research ten years in the future. We encourage everyone to join the conversation and share their thoughts. To login, please click the button below.</p>

					<p>The power of data has the potential to transform immune-mediated and infectious disease research.  Realizing this potential will necessarily involve careful consideration of bioethical concerns at scale: from issues affecting individual patients and their families to those affecting diverse communities around the globe.  The aim of this webinar is to navigate the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of data science as recent and future innovations shape immune-mediated and infectious disease research.</p>

				  	<summary style="font-size:large;">Breaking the Silos: Opportunities and Challenges of Harnessing the Power of Data to Advance Immune-Mediated and Infectious Disease Research - An Expert Panel Discussion (<i>Recorded on May 14th, 2:00-3:30pm ET</i>)</summary>
					<p>Transdisciplinary collaboration is critical to harnessing the power of data so that it can be used to rapidly transform the research landscape and advance science. Traditional research silos - which isolate laboratories, scholars, and research centers from one another - stymie essential partnerships that can bring together expertise, insights, and data to more rapidly and effectively address challenging research questions.  In this webinar, we examine the data silos that challenge immune-mediated and infectious disease research, highlight opportunities for breaking these silos, and seek input from the research community on where future efforts should be leveraged to foster rapid data sharing and broader collaboration.</p>

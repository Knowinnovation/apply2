            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>What if we could predict and even control how spatial organization and dynamic cellular interactions drive cancer development, using tractable, synthetic systems?</p>
            <p>Rapid advances are unfolding in both cancer systems biology and synthetic biology, creating new opportunities for discovery at their intersection. In cancer systems biology, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and imaging technologies allow researchers to build detailed computational models that reveal how patterns of gene expression, cell-cell interactions, and microenvironmental organization shape cancer biology, including tumorigenesis. These approaches are uncovering how local tissue environments, spatial organization, and dynamic cell-cell communication drive malignant transformation. In parallel, synthetic biology offers powerful tools to precisely modulate cellular activity in time and space. These tools have been used to design signaling systems guiding intercellular interactions, leverage optogenetics to probe cell function, and integrate multicellular circuits to develop responsive biomaterials and control spatial patterning and self-organization.  These complementary capabilities enable researchers to reconstruct and dynamically perturb signaling and cellular interactions in controlled settings, such as driving gene expression of specific cells within a tumor. When combined, the modeling power of systems biology and the control afforded by synthetic biology form a compelling platform for probing cancer complexity. This integration allows for rigorous, mechanistic testing of spatial and temporal hypotheses in tumor development, offering a framework that is highly relevant not only to cancer research, but to broader efforts to understand and engineer complex biological systems.</p>
            <p>The S³ (synthetic, systems, spatial biology) Innovation Lab will bring together researchers from various disciplines to explore how synthetic biology and systems biology can refine our understanding of cancer initiation. Participants will explore how predictive modeling, dynamic perturbation, and synthetic systems might be leveraged to test emerging biological hypotheses. This immersive event will promote interdisciplinary collaboration, leading to the development of pilot research proposals with strong potential for advancing cancer research. Participants will explore new ways to model, manipulate, and understand the spatial and temporal dimensions of cancer.</p>
            
            <h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
            <p>How can integrated synthetic and systems biology approaches be used to understand and manipulate spatiotemporal processes in cancer initiation?</p>
            <p><b>Key questions include:</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>What role does molecular and cellular spatial patterning play in cancer transformation?</li>
                <li>Can these patterns be measured, modeled, or perturbed to prevent or mitigate cancer initiation?</li>
                <li>What cancer types exhibit spatiotemporal dynamics that may be well suited to study the biology of early cancer development?</li>
                <li>What tools are needed to manipulate spatial organization and temporal signaling in tissues?</li>
              </ul>
            <p>This event is intended to bring together synthetic biologists, cancer systems biologists, and others to identify research questions uniquely suited to these approaches. The goal is to foster collaboration among multidisciplinary scientists who may not have worked together before, tackling emerging cancer research problems.</p>
            <p>Teams will ideate and develop pilot project proposals that combine computational modeling with synthetic biology experiments, including the bottom-up construction of biological systems and spatial perturbation of multicellular environments.</p>
          
            <h3>ABOUT THE EVENT</h3>
            <p>The S³ Innovation Lab is a five-day immersive experience designed to foster innovative thinking and new collaborations. From July 7-11, 2025, selected participants will join a highly interdisciplinary group, chosen in part for the low likelihood of prior collaboration, to address key research challenges in cancer initiation.</p>
            <p>Participants will work together in teams to develop research proposals, guided by expert mentors and peer feedback. The structured, facilitator-led process will allow participants to engage deeply with one another, refine their ideas, and form teams dedicated to testing emerging hypotheses in the field. Each day will build on the previous one, allowing participants to iterate and improve their project concepts. By the end of the event, teams will have developed pilot project proposals and formed new cross-disciplinary collaborations, laying the groundwork for future research.</p>

            <h3>WHO SHOULD APPLY</h3>
            <p>We welcome applications from researchers with diverse scientific backgrounds who are eager to collaborate and learn together.</p>
            <p>We encourage postdoc- and PI-level individuals with experience in areas such as, but not limited to, bioengineering, bioinformatics, cancer biology, cancer prevention, cell biology, clinical oncology, computational sciences, developmental biology, imaging, mathematical modeling, neuroscience, population sciences, spatial biology, synthetic biology, systems biology, and technology/methods development to apply. If this sounds interesting to you and you believe you have a unique, relative perspective, please apply.</p>

            <h3>HOW TO APPLY</h3>
            <p>Applications are due on Tuesday May 27, 2025.</p>
            <p>The meeting will be held virtually on July 7-11, 2025. <b>Attendance for the full workshop is required to ensure a productive, results-driven experience.</b> Selected participants will engage collaboratively on interdisciplinary teams to establish priority questions(s) and research proposal concepts in this hands-on event.</p>

            <h3>EVENT OUTCOMES</h3>
            <p>The S³ Innovation Lab will generate short, actionable research concepts and foster new cross-disciplinary collaborations. Participants will form teams to develop pilot project concepts that apply synthetic and systems biology approaches to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of cancer initiation. These proposals will be grounded in strong scientific rationale and designed for feasibility and future development.</p>
            <p>The Lab is also expected to build lasting connections among researchers from traditionally separate fields, strengthening a growing community focused on advancing tools and approaches to test emerging models of cancer initiation and to uncover fundamental biological insights into cancer initiation and the dynamic, spatial, and multicellular processes that drive disease.</p>

            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>The S続 (synthetic, systems, spatial biology) Innovation Lab is a five-day virtual event that will bring together interdisciplinary researchers to explore how synthetic and systems biology can expand insights from spatial biology to advance our understanding of cancer initiation. Participants will collaborate through a facilitator-led process to refine ideas, develop pilot research proposals, and form new research partnerships.</p>
            
            
            <h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
            <p>What if we could predict and control how spatial organization and dynamic cellular interactions drive cancer initiation, using integrated synthetic and systems biology approaches?</p>
            <p>New tools are driving rapid progress in cancer systems biology and synthetic biology, making it possible to ask and answer new questions about how cancer begins. In systems biology, high-resolution spatial measurements are revealing how local tissue context, spatial organization, and dynamic cell-cell communication influence cancer initiation. Meanwhile, synthetic biology enables precise control of cell behavior: guiding interactions, perturbing signaling, and directing spatial patterning. Together, these approaches offer a powerful framework for testing how spatial and temporal dynamics shape early cancer development.</p>
            <p>Leveraging predictive modeling, dynamic perturbation, and synthetic systems, we are poised to test emerging hypotheses and tackle compelling new questions, such as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>What role does molecular and cellular spatial patterning play in cancer transformation?</li>
                <li>Can these patterns be measured, modeled, or perturbed to prevent or mitigate cancer initiation?</li>
                <li>What cancer types exhibit spatiotemporal dynamics that may be well suited to study the biology of early cancer development?</li>
                <li>What tools are needed to manipulate spatial organization and temporal signaling in tissues?</li>
              </ul>
            
          
            <h3>ABOUT THE EVENT</h3>
            <p>The S続 Innovation Lab will bring together interdisciplinary researchers to explore how synthetic and systems biology can deepen our understanding of cancer initiation. Through a facilitator-led, immersive process designed to spur creativity, participants will collaborate to develop innovative pilot research proposals and form new research partnerships.</p>
            <p>This five-day virtual event (July 7-11, 2025) will unite participants across disciplines to address key research challenges in cancer initiation. Participants will work collaboratively to refine ideas and develop actionable research concepts, guided by expert mentors and peer feedback. Each day will build on the last, enabling teams to strengthen their proposals and form lasting collaborations for future research.</p>
            <p>Teams will explore ways to integrate computational modeling with synthetic biology experiments, including constructing biological systems from the bottom up and manipulating multicellular environments to study unresolved questions in cancer initiation.</p>

            <h3>WHO SHOULD APPLY</h3>
            <p>We welcome applications from researchers with experience in fields such as synthetic biology, systems biology, cancer biology, computational sciences, mathematical modeling, spatial biology, imaging, and technology or methods development, as well as bioengineering, bioinformatics, cancer prevention, cell biology, clinical oncology, developmental biology, neuroscience, and population sciences. Previous research or experience in cancer is not required - we seek broad expertise that can uniquely contribute to teams and expand perspectives. We encourage individuals at any career stage, who are eligible to apply for independent research funding, to apply.</p>
            <p>Participants must be committed to working closely within interdisciplinary teams to generate and refine new research ideas. Full attendance is required for a productive, results-driven experience.</p>


            <h3>EVENT OUTCOMES</h3>
            <p>The S続 Innovation Lab will generate actionable research concepts and foster cross-disciplinary collaborations. Participants will form teams to develop pilot project proposals that apply synthetic and systems biology approaches to study cancer initiation and dynamics. These proposals will be designed for feasibility and future development.</p>

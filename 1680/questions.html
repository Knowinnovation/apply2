           <h2>Theme #1: What are the major research questions and issues that must be addressed in order to advance K-12 math learning and education through the innovative use of data science and practices, technology and AI?</h2>
<h3>1A) Assessment of the NOW - of current knowledge in math learning and available datasets, from researcher and K-12 educational practitioner communities</h3>
<ul>
<li>What findings from basic research have been most exciting/insightful? Have they (if yes, how have they) been implemented to have significant impact on K-12 education?  (sample topics include – neural and cognitive underpinnings of math learning; measures of social-emotional attitudes and beliefs on math learning and their impacts; design and delivery of mathematics interventions in schools; use of real-time data of mathematical thinking and learning processes for adaptive cognitive support; the impact of language on math abilities esp.  in deaf and HDD learners; interplay of attention, executive function in math learning; personalized learning for math; LLMs in use for math learning)</li>
<li>What are knowledge gaps in research of math learning and in K-12 education; what major issues in K-12 math education have not been adequately addressed by basic research?</li>
<p>Some considerations for future:</p>
<li>What types or combinations of types of data would have been useful towards addressing those gaps?</li>
<li>How would use and safe reapplication of existing learning data fill knowledge gaps; and if not, why not? What new data and research approaches would be needed?</li>
<li>How frequently have the workshop participants used datasets created by others?  What are some examples of data re-purpose? What are the barriers to utilization of current datasets and how can they be overcome?</li>
</ul>
<h3>1B) Fostering two-way collaboration between researchers and practitioners[BW2].  How to better use our understanding of how people learn to inform educational practice and policy, and conversely, how can we use knowledge and experience gained from educational practice to test and refine our theories?</h3>
<ul>
<li>How can we improve the production and uptake of scientific knowledge about how people learn for use in education policies and practices?</li>
<li>How can we improve a mutual research-practice production and uptake of scientific knowledge about learning for use in education policies and practices?</li>
<li>How might iterative data-driven engineering and design play a role?</li>
<li>How can we better use the knowledge and experience of teachers and other education practitioners to test/refine theories and to inform future research agendas?</li>
<li>How can we better engage/include practitioners in the research process?</li>
<li>How can we better engage/include families in the research process?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some considerations for future:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the barriers to researcher - practitioner collaboration on data generation, analysis, and re-use?</li>
<li>What features of a supportive ecosystem and related workforce-training priorities will optimize mutually reinforcing learning among the key players – basic science researchers and education practitioners and policy makers?</li>
<li>What are the unique features of K-12 math learning (if any) that should be core priorities of this ecosystem?</li>
</ul>
<h3>1C) Improving our research, education, and data generating practices to ensure that the evidence minimizes bias and is relevant to informing education practice and policy for ALL.</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the current deficiencies and pitfalls associated with current datasets?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some considerations for future:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we improve data generation and analysis in ways that take into consideration the complex interactions of socio-cultural factors that impinge on learners to impact their learning?</li>
<li>What types/ combinations of datasets and approaches are needed to advance knowledge about math learning in underserved and under-represented communities in order to more effectively ensure equity in K-12 math learning and education?</li>
<li>How can we advance understanding of math learning in neurodiverse populations to inform interventions for learning difficulties and learning disabilities?</li>
<li>How can we engage/include neurodiverse scholars in the research process about their own communities to achieve optimal systemic impact?</li>
<li>What gaps in training need to be addressed?  Who needs additional training and how?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Theme #2: Looking to the future, how can we build a data-sharing ecosystem which capitalizes on the affordance of data science, better data practice, technology and AI to support new directions in advancing K-12 math learning and Education?</h2>


<h3>2A) – How do we promote collective learning and FUTURE coordinated efforts among Science of Learning, math learning and AI researchers, data scientists, teachers and education administrators/policy makers to make better use of existing data,  and to collaborate on generation of new data?</h3>
<p>Potential themes are based on anticipated sharing of different datasets from diverse methodologies and contexts, enabled by provision of appropriate socio-technical support.  A priority is to keep in mind the questions/ issues/problems identified by participants on Day 1 to explore how new and higher quality datasets could mitigate some of the problems or provide solutions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>What data accumulated from how young and older children learn number concepts and mathematics (arithmetic, algebra, geometry) across preK-12 can be used for machine learning and development of human-inspired machine learning approaches (e.g. more complex use of reasoning and statistical learning than in current algorithms).  What steps should be taken to ensure robustness and generalizability of data (e.g.) to counter biased sampling etc.)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some considerations for future: </p>
<ul>
<li>What areas of potential innovation in AI and in Science of Learning can be advanced through multimodal sensing of the cognitive, affective, and physical states (eg., EEG, fNIRS, eye-tracking, facial and speech recognition, autonomic nervous system measurements (e.g., thermal-emotional imaging), motion capture, pose estimation, and computer vision) of the learner during the process of learning math?</li>
<li>How can AI modelling of the learner, learner states (of mind), and learning processes be used to test/refine our theories of math learning in humans across multiple contexts?</li>
<li>How can AI modeling advance early identification of math learning disabilities?</li>
<li>How can AI modeling advance innovative individual intervention approaches?</li>
<li>What are opportunities for new experimental paradigms for research on math learning that build on an ever-increasing data stream from on-line student learning?</li>
<li>What combinations of essential data from human studies are likely to make AI-mediated technological advances in personalized learning and teaching of mathematics, customized for individual differences?</li>
<li>What types of data and data-driven information will be most useful for teachers?</li>
</ul>
<h3>2B) Workforce preparation to create a sustainable and equitable future in for K-12 math learning and education.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Would, and if yes, how would the creation of a Socio-technical platform associated with CAMEL provide opportunity and means to meet the challenge of making meaningful advances through analysis of data amassed from math learning research and education?</li> 
<li>Absent such a platform, how do you envision alternate opportunities for practical training to use diverse and new types of data more effectively, and to train researchers (students and faculty) in approaches to reliable data curation, analysis, and sharing? For improved scientific practices including experimental design (powering of studies and appropriate blinding), greater sophistication in statistics, big data analyses, ethical generation and use of data, and awareness of limitations with specific datasets?</li>
<li>What are the research and educations transformations that could be had if we can more fully capitalize on the full range of methodological approaches and types of data now available?</li>
<li>What new directions need to be taken for developing innovative models of data-intensive discovery that can support agile responses to new challenges and opportunities?</li>
<li>How can and should we move beyond a narrow view of mathematics current that is taught in school?  What different research (such as ethnography) and new directions need to be taken for shaping mathematics education to be responsive to our current and future needs (e.g. increasingly data-rich and socio-technological)? What are the processes for creating change and who gets to decide what is important for now and for the future? Why is it hard for a broadened view of math to gain tractions?  What are some examples of success?</li>

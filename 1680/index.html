<h3>Workshop Overview</h3>

    <p>This no-cost to participate, virtual-only event brings together Science of Learning, Education Research, Data Science & AI expertise to engage a community of interdisciplinary scientists, education researchers and education practitioners, with shared goals of advancing K-12 mathematics learning and education through innovative use of data science and AI. </p>
            <p><strong>WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU!</strong></p>
      <p>This two-day online event (May 23-24, 2024) aims to identify insights that will inform future funding opportunities to be supported by the US National Science Foundation in partnership with philanthropic organizations.</p>

            
            
            <p>The intention of this workshop is to explore what and how major research questions about learning and teaching of mathematics would benefit from the building of a mathematics research and education data sharing ecosystem. This includes ideas for training of data science skills and development of tools for the science and education communities to actively use these new affordances.</p>

<p>The workshop discussions will inform future funding priorities to catalyze innovations in research and practice of K-12 math learning and education. In particular, we are interested in research topics and new approaches that can be advanced through innovative use of datasets and AI.</p>

<p>Participants will be invited to collaborate on a synthesis report to address capacity building, including key challenges in data sharing, use/reuse, and machine learning applications within context of research on mathematics learning and mathematics education.</p> 


            <h3>Opportunities and Challenges</h3>
            <p>Scientific knowledge about how people learn, including how people learn mathematics, have the potential to drive innovations in K-12 mathematics learning and education.  There is also potential  to more fully engage education researchers and  teachers with their knowledge and experience as partners for innovation.</p>

<p>One challenge is that insights and scientific evidence about human learning are fragmented across disciplinary lines. There is critical need to integrate these findings and provide useable information that can be taken up by practitioners.  Another challenge is that the researcher and practitioner communities do not usually attend the same meetings.</p>

<p>This partnership of the NSF and named philanthropies seeks to create an active collaboration of researchers and education practitioners to overcome the above mentioned challenges; and who will create new pathways through innovative use/re-use of datasets and associated tools to advance math learning and education.  A key focus is  to improve access to quality education for all, with particular attention to historically under-represented and under-served students.</p>

<p>The work will focus on the creation, production, and ecosystem-building around K-12 datasets that will a elevate meaningful use of valuable datasets at the intersections of the social, behavioral and cognitive sciences, and K-12 education.  This in turn will build capacity of researchers and educators to leverage data science, technological advances and AI for new avenues of scientific investigations and education practice.</p>

            
            <h3>Workshop Structure</h3>
            <p>Research data sets are often treated as a byproduct of the research process. This means that the data can be stored in non-standard ways, often makes it difficult for other researchers to locate and use relevant data sets. In order to accelerate the pace of educational research it is necessary for the research community to address the need to elevate meaningful use of valuable datasets at the intersections of the social, behavioral, and economic sciences and K-12 education, with a focus on supporting historically marginalized groups. Fundamentally, the research community must treat their data sets as asset for future work.</p>
            <p>In order to address these challenges, workshop participants will be invited to explore three major themes</p>
            <ul>
              <li>#1 Exploring the current knowledge in math learning and available datasets</li>
              <li>#2 Optimizing relevance and use of data from future coordinated efforts in math learning and education</li>
              <li>#3 Preparing future researchers for data-intensive discovery</li>
            </ul>
            <details>
              <summary><strong>Please click here to read more about the themes, and the underlying questions</strong></summary>
              <p>Theme 1: Assessment of the NOW - of current knowledge in math learning and available datasets, from researcher and K-12 educational practitioner communities</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>What findings from basic research have been or would be most exciting/insightful? Have they been implemented to and have they had a significant impact on K-12 education?  (topics include – neural and cognitive underpinnings of math learning; measures of social-emotional attitudes and beliefs on math learning and their impacts; design and delivery of mathematics interventions in schools; use of real-time data of mathematical thinking and learning processes for adaptive cognitive support; the impact of language on math abilities esp.  in deaf and HDD learners; interplay of attention, executive function in math learning)</li>
                  <li>What are knowledge gaps in research of math learning and in K-12 education; what major issues in K-12 math education have not been adequately addressed by basic research?</li>
                  <li>What types or combinations of types of data would have been useful?</li>
                  <li>How would use and safe reapplication of existing learning data fill knowledge gaps; and if not, why not? What new data and research approaches would be needed?</li>
                  <li>How frequently have the workshop participants used datasets created by others?  What are some examples of data-reuse? What are the barriers to utilization of current datasets and how can they be overcome? </li>
                  <li>What are the barriers to researcher - practitioner collaboration on data generation, analysis and re-use?</li>
                  <li>What features of a supportive ecosystem and related workforce-training priorities will optimize mutually reinforcing learning among the key players – basic science researchers and education practitioners and policy makers?</li>
                </ul>
              <p>Theme 2: Leveraging collective learning among BCS math and AI researchers, teachers and education administrators/policy makers to optimize relevance and use of data from FUTURE coordinated efforts in math learning and education</p>
              <p>Potential themes are ones based on anticipated sharing of different datasets from diverse methodologies, enabled by the socio-technical support from the platform.  Selected topics are picked from leading-edge aspirations (goals, not necessary attained yet) of NSF funded awards </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>What data accumulated from how young and older children and learn number concepts and mathematics  (arithmetic, algebra, geometry) across preK-12 can be used for machine learning and development of human-inspired machine learning approaches (e.g. more complex use of reasoning and statistical learning than in current algorithms)</li>
                    <li>What areas of potential innovation in AI and in Science of Learning can be advanced through multimodal sensing of the cognitive, affective and physical states (EEG, eye-tracking, facial and speech recognition, computer vision) of the learner during the process of learning?</li>
                    <li>How can AI modelling of the learner, learner states (of mind), and learning processes be used to test/refine  our theories of math learning in humans across multiple contexts?</li>
                    <li>What are opportunities for new experimental paradigms for research on math learning that build on ever increasing data stream from on-line student learning?</li>
                    <li>What combinations of essential data from human studies are likely to make  AI-mediated technological advances in personalized learning and teaching of mathematics,  customized for individual differences? (I picked personalized learning here because of the recent ENG initiative on Personalized Engineering Learning – which promises additional human learning datasets that could inform AI -mediated engineered solutions to learning – potential for ENG contribution to Strategy 2 infrastructure?)</li> 
                  </ul>
              <p>Theme 3: - Preparing future researchers for data-intensive discovery</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The creation of the Socio-technical platform (strategy 2) provides opportunity and means to meet the challenge of making meaningful advances through analysis of data amassed from math learning research and education.   This is particularly critical given the diverse methodological approaches and types of data.  The platform will provide opportunities for practical training to more effectively use diverse and new types of data, and how to train researchers (students and faculty), in approaches to reliable data curation, analysis and sharing. These skills dovetail with the need to develop innovative models of data-intensive discovery that are grounded in improved scientific practices including  experimental design (powering of studies and appropriate blinding), greater sophistication in statistics,  and ethical generation and use of data.</li>
                </ul>
            </details>
 
         
            <h3>Desired Outcomes</h3>
            <p>This workshop will identify the major research questions and issues for the advancement of math learning and education.  It will identify opportunities and challenges inherent in building a mathematics research and education data- sharing ecosystem.  Discussions will also inform priorities for human capacity building and infrastructure necessary for the Science of Learning (neuroscience, social behavioral and cognitive sciences, computer science and engineering) and Education research communities to capitalize on cutting-edge data science and AI  opportunities.</p>

<p>To facilitate the open access of scientific evidence and research findings, the workshop organizers would create a catalog of any data sets which the participants would like to share with the community. The  registration form includes space to submit the details of these data sets.</p>

<p>The primary tangible output of the event will be a synthesis report that outlines the key research issues in math learning and education that can be advanced with existing datasets, or those that can serve as compelling drivers for creation of new datasets and new analytical tools.  To these ends, and to the potential use of the datasets for machine learning input, there will be suggestions for how to build capacity of the research and education communities in context of advancing math learning and education.</p>

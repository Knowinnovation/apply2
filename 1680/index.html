              <h3>Key Information</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Dates: 23rd and 24th of May from 11am to 5pm ET </li>
                <li>The two-day virtual workshop is focused on identifying opportunities at the intersection of mathematics education, artifical intelligence, and data science</li>
                <li>Although the workshop is open to any interested researcher, yhe organizers are particularly interested to receive applications from:
                  <ul>
                    <li>discipline 1</li>
                    <li>discipline 2</li>
                    <li>discipline 3</li>
                  </ul>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Through the partnership with the Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and the Walton Family Foundation, the SBE Directorate will address important challenges for SBE/NSF and present new opportunities to catalyze innovations in research and practice of K-12 math learning and education. Specifically, the partnership will identify important new research directions to advance math learning, integrate findings from diverse disciplines, and facilitate their use to inform educational practice in K-12. </p>
            <p>The work will build on existing datasets and create new ones; it will address the need to elevate meaningful use of valuable datasets at the intersections of the social, behavioral, and economic sciences and K-12 education, with a focus on supporting historically marginalized groups, and to change pervasive attitudes of treating data as a byproduct of research rather than as an asset or resource for future work. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><strong>The event will be held online May 23 &mdash; 24, 2024.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Challenge description goes here. </p>
 

            <h3>The Workshop</h3>
                      <p>This lab brought together ~100 wildland fire researchers working in a variety of fields including ecology and evolutionary processes; systematics and biodiversity science; geomorphology and land surface processes; hydrology; biogeochemistry; computational and modeling sciences; engineering; atmospheric sciences; remote sensing; computer science; and those exploring the human dimensions of wildfire. Researchers working with cyberinfrastructure, with facilities such as NEON and NCAR, with NASA satellites and campaigns, with industry partners, and with research networks such as CZO and Ameriflux, were welcomed, as well as those working on education and outreach initiatives and workforce professional development. Innovation Lab participants recognized that forming new collaborations and developing innovative approaches were essential to address challenges associated with studying wildfire and its impacts. </p>

         
            <h3>Desired Outcomes</h3>
            <p>This workshop will identify the major <strong>questions</strong> and <strong>opportunities<strong></strong> inherent in building a <strong>mathematics research data sharing ecosystem</strong>, and developing the necessary skills and tools for the educational research community to make use of these new opportunities. </p>
              <p>The tangible output of this project will be a synthesis report that outlines the key questions/barriers to sharing and reusing math's educational research data. This is particularly focused on using the data for machine learning input. </p>

    <h3>Shaping the Future of Mathematics Education: A Data Science & AI Workshop </h3>

    <p>Join leading data science, mathematics education, and artificial intelligence researchers in a pioneering workshop exploring the intersection of mathematics, artificial intelligence, and data science. This two-day online event (May 23-24, 2024) aims to identify insights for improving K-12 math learning, particularly for historically marginalized groups.</p>

    <p>Participants will be invited to collaborate on a synthesis report to address key challenges in data sharing, reuse, and machine learning applications within mathematics education.</p>

   
            
            <h3>Workshop Overview</h3>
            <p>The intention of this workshop is to identify the major questions and opportunities inherent in building a mathematics research data sharing ecosystem, and develop the necessary skills and tools for the educational research community to make use of these new opportunities. </p>
            <p>The workshop is supported through the partnership with the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Gates Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.schmidtfutures.org/" target="_blank">Schmidt Futures</a>, the <a href="https://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Walton Family Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/sbe" target="_blank">SBE Directorate</a>. It will address important challenges for SBE/NSF and present new opportunities to catalyze innovations in research and practice of K-12 math learning and education. Specifically, the partnership will identify important new research directions to advance math learning, integrate findings from diverse disciplines, and facilitate their use to inform educational practice in K-12. </p>

            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Research data sets are often treated as a byproduct of the research process. This means that the data can be stored in non-standard ways, often makes it difficult for other researchers to locate and use relevant data sets. In order to accelerate the pace of educational research it is necessary for the research community to address the need to elevate meaningful use of valuable datasets at the intersections of the social, behavioral, and economic sciences and K-12 education, with a focus on supporting historically marginalized groups. Fundamentally, the research community must treat their data sets as asset for future work.</p>
 
         
            <h3>Desired Outcomes</h3>
            <p>This workshop will identify the major questions and opportunities inherent in building a mathematics research data sharing ecosystem, and developing the necessary skills and tools for the educational research community to make use of these new opportunities. </p>
              <p>The primary tangible output of the event will be a synthesis report that outlines the key questions/barriers to sharing and reusing math's educational research data. This is particularly focused on using the data for machine learning input. </p>
            <p>In addition to the report, the organizers would also like to create a catalog of any data sets which the participants would like to share with the community. The application form includes space to submit the details of these data sets.</p>

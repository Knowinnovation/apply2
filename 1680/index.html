    <h1>Shaping the Future of Mathematics Education: A Data Science & AI Workshop </h1>

    <p>Join leading mathematics education researchers and data scientists in a pioneering workshop exploring the intersection of mathematics, artificial intelligence, and data science. This two-day online event (May 23-24, 2024) aims to identify insights for improving K-12 math learning, particularly for historically marginalized groups.</p>

    <p>Collaborate on a synthesis report to address key challenges in data sharing, reuse, and machine learning applications within mathematics education. Spark new research initiatives and build a network of like-minded innovators.</p>

   
            
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The intention of this workshop is to identify the major questions and opportunities inherent in building a mathematics research data sharing ecosystem, and developing the necessary skills and tools for the educational research community to make use of these new opportunities. </p>
            <p>Through the partnership with the Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and the Walton Family Foundation, the SBE Directorate will address important challenges for SBE/NSF and present new opportunities to catalyze innovations in research and practice of K-12 math learning and education. Specifically, the partnership will identify important new research directions to advance math learning, integrate findings from diverse disciplines, and facilitate their use to inform educational practice in K-12. </p>
            <p>The work will build on existing datasets and create new ones; it will address the need to elevate meaningful use of valuable datasets at the intersections of the social, behavioral, and economic sciences and K-12 education, with a focus on supporting historically marginalized groups, and to change pervasive attitudes of treating data as a byproduct of research rather than as an asset or resource for future work. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><strong>The event will be held online May 23 &mdash; 24, 2024.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>The work will build on existing datasets and create new ones; it will address the need to elevate meaningful use of valuable datasets at the intersections of the social, behavioral, and economic sciences and K-12 education, with a focus on supporting historically marginalized groups, and to change pervasive attitudes of treating data as a byproduct of research rather than as an asset or resource for future work.</p>
 

            <h3>The Workshop</h3>
                      <p>The two-day virtual workshop is focused on identifying opportunities at the intersection of mathematics education, artifical intelligence, and data science</p>
         
            <h3>Desired Outcomes</h3>
            <p>This workshop will identify the major <strong>questions</strong> and <strong>opportunities<strong></strong> inherent in building a <strong>mathematics research data sharing ecosystem</strong>, and developing the necessary skills and tools for the educational research community to make use of these new opportunities. </p>
              <p>The tangible output of this project will be a synthesis report that outlines the key questions/barriers to sharing and reusing math's educational research data. This is particularly focused on using the data for machine learning input. </p>

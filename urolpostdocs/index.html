            <h2>Hi postdocs!<p>Thank you for your interest in attending one of the URoL Workshops after the Town Hall on March 15.</p></h2>
            <p>Everyone is invited to attend the Town Hall on March 15, 2022. Based on input from the scientific community at the Town Hall, the NSF will hold four workshops to explore different URoL topics in greater detail. We anticipate accepting about 25 postdocs to attend each URoL Workshop, for a total of 100 postdocs. Your acceptance comes with an expectation for you to participate in three additional "Incubators" which are designed to make your participation in the Workshops productive and fulfilling.</p><p>Please mark all dates below in your calendar for now. Once you are accepted to a URoL workshop, you can release the other URoL Workshop and Writing Incubator dates.</p>

            <h3>What are the objectives for these Incubators?</h3>
            <p><b>FIRST</b> - To prepare you for your role at the URoL workshop.</p><p><b>SECOND</b> - To network with other postdocs who share interests in similar or overlapping science domains.</p><p><b>THIRD</b> - To give you time and space to reflect on the collaborative, cross-disciplinary and use-inspired research future of your own career.</p>
        
<h2>About the Incubators</h2>
<h3>Kick-off Incubator</h3>
<p>The kick-off incubator will be on April 12 following the URoL Workshop Orientation. We will have break-out sessions with small groups of postdocs to discuss framing questions on the challenges of cross-disciplinary, use-inspired research (goals, opportunities, resource needs, etc.). In addition, your group will brainstorm potential topics for papers (see below).</p>


            <h3>Writing Incubators</h3>
            <p>Your team will attend one of two Writing Incubators. Which one will depend on which URoL workshop you attend; they are scheduled for April 22nd (for attendees of URoL Workshops 1 and 2) and May 2nd (for attendees of URoL Workshops 3 and 4).</p><p>Your team is expected to produce a paper from the URoL Workshop and Incubator activities. The content will be decided by your group.  Possibilities include an outline of a research project or conference or conference session; a paper (potentially for publication) on a scientific topic related to the URoL workshop; a paper giving advice to the community and NSF on how to involve postdocs in the different stages of cross-disciplinary research. These topics are not prescriptive - you get to decide with your group.</p>
            <h3>Wrap-up Incubator</h3>
            <p>This incubator provides an opportunity for you to meet and learn about the activities of postdocs who participated in the other three URoL Workshops. There will also be some activities to help you envision your research career and strategies over the next 10+ years.</p>
            <h3>Registration for the Town Hall is now CLOSED</h3>
            <p>For those of you who have registered already, the Town Hall on March 15 Town Hall will define the topics that we will explore in greater depth at the subsequent workshops.</p>
            <p><a class="button special" href="https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/35b58b3105a94383a48c30444be2568a" target="_blank">Registration for the Town Hall is now CLOSED&gt;&gt;</a></p>
            <p>After the Town Hall we will invite you to apply to participate in the Workshops. Space limitation mean that we can only accept a maximum of 25 postdoc participants per workshop - for this reason the workshop application will ask you to identify your first and second choice workshop topics. We will share details about the application process the week after the Town Hall.</p>

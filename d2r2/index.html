              <h4>What Is An Ideas Lab?</h4>
              <p>An <em>Ideas Lab</em> is a 5-day event for an interdisciplinary group of scientists working to develop innovative research concepts for a wicked hard problem.</p>
              <p>There are no lengthy keynotes or panels, no symposia or poster sessions. This will be an immersive, dynamic event in which you'll be intellectually and creatively challenged while you generate, explore, and develop unique, ambitious research concepts.</p>

            <h4>Join a 5-day event to develop novel cross-disciplinary collaborations!</h4>
            <p><strong>Applications are due January 31st 2022 (5:00pm Local Time). Apply Today!</strong></p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The mystery of how organisms' genomes produce the variety of phenotypes observed in nature is at a profound and interesting place. Decades of work and discovery have helped us understand how RNA, transcribed from DNA, is used to encode proteins, which then fold into structures that provide various functions to an organism. This protein-coding RNA however, only accounts for a fraction of the total RNA in the cell. There is another major segment of an organism's genome which is transcribed to RNA but does not encode for proteins. We want YOU to join the D2R2 Ideas Lab and contribute to understanding these mysteries of the genome.</p>
            <p style="font-weight:bold;">The focus will be to develop novel perspectives and approaches to push the boundaries of understanding the evolutionary and functional significance of non-coding RNA.</p>
            <h3>Date &amp; Location</h3>
            <p><strong>The event will be held at the Airlie House in Warrenton, VA on June 13th through 17th 2022.</strong></p>
            <p>Applicants must commit to participating for the entire duration of the Ideas Lab if selected to attend.</p>
            <p>There will also be some required prework and light background reading/viewing.</p>
            <p>If needed, we are ready to convert this to an entirely online event.</p>
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Although our ability to sequence, analyze, and manipulate genomes has significantly advanced in the last two decades, we still have not solved the grand challenge of understanding how genomes encode the complete set of instructions for complex and adaptable organisms. Much recent attention has focused on RNAs that do not encode proteins but may show signatures of evolutionary conservation, unusual structural features, and/or non-random expression patterns that are suggestive of their functional roles. It is now clear that these “non-coding RNAs” perform important functions in the cell, but the vast majority remain uncharacterized. It is likely that the underlying rules governing the evolution and function of non-coding RNAs are different from those of protein-coding ones; hence fresh perspectives and novel approaches are needed to unveil the syntax and semantics of this hidden language. A wealth of new biology awaits discovery, powered by transformative technologies and approaches to illuminate the dark dimensions of the RNA regulome, and decipher the role of non-coding RNAs in shaping the form and function of living organisms through evolution.</p>
            <h3>Who Should Apply</h3>
            <p>Irrespective of expertise, we are most interested in new, innovative ideas and original thinking that arise from new collaborations among people of diverse backgrounds and varying expertise.</p>
            <p>In addition to RNA Biologists, this lab welcomes researchers from diverse backgrounds and disciplines to tackle this problem. This will include evolutionary biologists, structural biologists, synthetic biologists, computational scientists, and biophysicists, just to name a few pertinent fields. Thinking even more broadly, any discipline that is focused on discovering and interpreting patterns in data could play a role, including linguists, cryptographers, astronomers, and anyone focused on signal processing. If you think you may have something to contribute, please apply.</p>
            <h3>The Opportunity</h3>
            <p>The Ideas Lab is intended to be a fun and stimulating experience that will facilitate the development of new ideas and approaches to the study of non-coding RNA. We expect that participants will...</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Brainstorm with other creative researchers from the RNA field and beyond</li>
              <li>Explore the boundaries of their own knowledge and preconceptions</li>
              <li>Bring new tools and approaches to established research questions</li>
              <li>Establish new collaborations to generate and develop novel research ideas</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At the conclusion of the lab, NSF will invite approximately five teams to submit collaborative research proposals that will allow them to pursue the ideas developed during the lab.</p>
            <h3>Meeting Outcomes</h3>
            <p>The Ideas Lab will guide attending scientists in generating and exploring many novel research concepts in this area, cultivate the best ideas in an iterative fashion, and allowing teams to form to develop and pursue these research concepts.</p>
            <h3>Why and How to Apply</h3>
            <p><strong>It’s simple – just a 2-page application! (See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22510/nsf22510.htm">NSF 22-510</a>)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Application Deadline: January 31st 2022 (5:00pm Local Time)</strong></p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The NCI Health Disparities Innovation Lab Project is an exciting initiative that aims to accelerate progress in advancing cancer health equity. Join us as we embrace the complexity of cancer health disparities (CHDs) and catalyze transdisciplinary approaches to uncover sustainable solutions. This collaborative event brings together experts from diverse sectors to address the persistent challenges of CHDs and drive meaningful change.</p>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Addressing the complex web of factors contributing to cancer health disparities (CHDs) requires innovative approaches that integrate knowledge across disciplines and communities. By leveraging the expertise of diverse stakeholders, we aim to identify high-impact interventions and develop novel conceptual frameworks to reduce CHDs. Join us in this challenge to accelerate progress towards achieving health equity for all populations.</p>
          
            <h3>The Event</h3>
            <p>The NCI Health Disparities Innovation Lab Project consists of two key phases. </p>
            <h4><b>PHASE 01</b></h4>
            <p>In Phase 1, the Virtual Scoping Sessions, we will engage in collaborative discussions to understand the complexity of CHDs and integrate existing data and knowledge. Through a series of virtual events, participants will explore three thematic areas:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Acknowledging Complexity</li>
              <li>Integrating Knowledge Across Disciplines, Formats, and Systems.</li>
              <li>Meaningful Engagement of Impacted Communities</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These sessions will provide a platform to identify research opportunities suited for transdisciplinary approaches.</p>
            <h4><b>PHASE 02</b></h4>
            <p>Phase 2 will be a Conceptual Framework Workshop, where selected participants will work intensively over five days to develop innovative frameworks. These frameworks will unravel the complex causal web of CHDs and identify high leverage points for context-specific actionable solutions. The pilot projects developed from these frameworks will provide proof-of-principle for transdisciplinary research towards achieving high leverage CHD outcomes.</p>


            <h3>Who Should Attend</h3>
            <p>The NCI Health Disparities Innovation Lab Project welcomes participants from a diverse range of sectors and backgrounds. Researchers, experts, professionals, and advocates in the fields of cancer research, public health, social sciences, data science, community engagement, and related disciplines are encouraged to attend. We are particularly interested in involving individuals who can contribute unique perspectives to address the complex challenges of cancer health disparities.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Join us for a transformative workshop series organized by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and facilitated by Knowinnovation. This event aims to accelerate progress towards reducing cancer health disparities (CHD) by leveraging transdisciplinary research approaches and envisioning a future of health equity for all populations. Through three stages of Visioning Minilabs, Ideation Minilabs, and an Innovation Lab, we will explore unique research opportunities and ideate approaches/solutions to advance the science of CHD.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Despite significant investment, cancer health disparities persist. This event aims to explore new perspectives and catalyze innovative research approaches to grapple with the complex nature of CHD and accelerate progress towards reducing disparities. By embracing the complexity of CHD, enabling data and knowledge integration, and expanding community engagement, we strive to address the root causes of health inequities.
            </p>
          <hr>
            <h3>About the Workshops</h3>
            <p>The NCI Cancer Disparities: Embrace the Complexity Project includes a dynamic series of workshops organized in 3 sequential stages, with each stage building on the outcomes of the previous stages. The stages comprise (1) three virtual Visioning Minilabs, (2) five virtual Ideation Minilabs and (3) one in-person Innovation Lab.  
            </p>
            <p>The workshops are intense, interactive, and free-thinking, with each involving diverse groups and organizations. The goal is to bring together individuals who represent a wide-range of disciplines, perspectives, and backgrounds so that they may interact and learn from one another while co-creating an integrated vision for future CHD research and identifying unique opportunities and approaches to advance the vision. Participants will be expected to engage constructively in dialogue with each other, the facilitators, and the Subject Guides (experts in the field who will help to frame and guide discussions).  
            </p>
           
            <h4><b>Stage 01: Virtual Visioning Minilabs</b> [Three 1.5-hour Sessions]</h4>
            
              <p>The objective of Stage 01 is to facilitate direct small group discussions that engage a broad community. Together, participants will reflect on the current state of cancer health disparities (CHD), expanding and refining their understanding of the thematic areas. Our goal is to collectively envision the desired future state(s) of equity in cancer control and explore a wide range of potential CHD research opportunities. Through these discussions, we aim to grapple with the complex nature of CHD and accelerate progress towards achieving the envisioned future states. Participants will develop a list of unique CHD research opportunities that are suited to transdisciplinary research approaches.
              </p>
            
          
            
            <h4><b>Stage 02: Virtual Ideation Minilabs</b> [Five 4-hour Sessions]</h4>
        
              <p>The objective of Stage 02 is to engage a focused group of diverse individuals to delve deeper into the opportunities identified in Stage 01. The aim is to narrow down and clarify these opportunities, taking into account possible constraints, and generate innovative ideas, solutions, and actions to advance progress in transdisciplinary research. A carefully selected group of individuals who demonstrate collaborative spirit, open-mindedness, and represent diverse disciplines, backgrounds, and perspectives will be chosen from the pool of applicants to participate in a series of five 4-hour virtual sessions. The application process is open to all, including individuals who participated in Stage 01.
              </p>
              
            <p>Participants will create comprehensive white papers that summarize a collection of distinctive CHD research opportunities, both domestic and global, which are highly suitable for transdisciplinary research. Ultimately, the goal is to accelerate progress and promote equity in cancer control.
            </p>

            <h3>Event Outcomes</h3>
            By participating in the Cancer Disparities: Embrace the Complexity (CDEC) Minilabs, you will have the opportunity to actively contribute to cutting-edge research, collaborate with experts from diverse fields, and play a vital role in driving meaningful change. This event aims to create a common language and conceptual understanding of cancer health disparities while generating impactful white papers. These white papers will serve as a compendium, highlighting unique CHD research opportunities that are well-suited for transdisciplinary approaches. In addition, they will address constraints and present a range of solutions and actions to advance transdisciplinary research, ultimately working towards achieving equity in cancer control. The valuable outcomes from this project will provide guidance for future research endeavors on a global scale.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Join us for a transformative workshop series organized by the National Cancer Society and National Institute of Health, facilitated by Knowinnovation. This event aims to address cancer health disparities (CHDs) by leveraging transdisciplinary approaches and envisioning a future of health equity for all populations. Through three stages of Visioning Minilabs, Ideation Minilabs, and Innovation Labs, we will explore unique research opportunities, ideate solutions, and develop conceptual frameworks to advance the science of CHDs.</p>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Despite significant investment, cancer health disparities persist. This event aims to tackle the complex nature of CHDs and catalyze innovative research approaches to accelerate progress and reduce disparities. By acknowledging the complexity of CHDs, enabling data and knowledge integration, and expanding community engagement, we strive to address the root causes of health inequities.</p>
          
            <h3>The Event</h3>
            <p>The NCI Health Disparities Innovation Lab Project will consist of a series of events: 3 virtual Visioning Minilabs and 5 virtual Ideation Minilabs representing diverse groups and organizations. These events represent Stages 1 and 2 of a 3-Stage Project. Each minilab will be highly interactive and build on the outcomes of previous minilabs. </p>
           
            <h4><b>Stage 01: Visioning Minilabs</b></h4>
            
              <p><b>Objective</b></p>
              <p>The purpose of this stage is to facilitate direct small group discussions that engage a broad community. Together, we will reflect on the current state of cancer health disparities (CHDs), expanding and refining our understanding of the thematic areas. Our goal is to collectively envision the desired future state(s) of equity in cancer control and explore a wide range of potential CHD research opportunities. Through these discussions, we aim to tackle the complex nature of CHDs and accelerate progress towards achieving the envisioned future states.</p>
            
              <p><b>Question(s)</b></p>
              <p>Where do we want to go? What does success look like? What are the research opportunities to get us there and which ones are suited to transdisciplinary approaches?</p>
            
              <p><b>Process</b></p>
              <p>To foster open dialogue, gain a broad, multi-disciplinary perspective, and stimulate new ideas, we are inviting up to 400 participants who have a genuine interest in this topic and are open-minded to engage in Stage 1. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) will actively promote and encourage participation from a wide range of disciplines, backgrounds, and perspectives.</p>
              <p>The Stage 01 series will consist of three short virtual events, each lasting 1.5 hours. These events will feature facilitated discussions in small groups, with a focus on ensuring diversity of perspectives, disciplines, and backgrounds within each group. We strongly encourage participants to join all three virtual sessions, as each session will build upon the previous ones, creating a cohesive and progressive exploration of the topic.</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Session 1:</b> Envisage possible desired future states of equity in cancer control and a range of CHDs research opportunities that if pursued today will accelerate progress to attain these states (without considering any constraints).</li>
                <li><b>Session 2:</b> Reflect on the current state of CHDs, expanding/refining the 3 thematic areas as needed (embracing the complexities, integrating knowledge across disciplines/formats/systems, and meaningfully engaging the impacted communities).</li>
                <li><b>Session 3:</b> Refine the list of the possible CHDs research opportunities converging around unique opportunities that are best suited for novel transdisciplinary research approaches (including opportunities where global research could accelerate progress).</li>
              </ol>
            <p><b>Desired Outcome</b></p>
            <p>A curated list of unique CHDs research opportunities that are suited to transdisciplinary research approaches.</p>
            
            <h4><b>Stage 02: Ideation Minilabs</b></h4>
            
              <p><b>Objective</b></p>
              <p>The objective of Stage 2 is to engage a focused group of diverse individuals to delve deeper into the opportunities identified in Stage 1. The aim is to narrow down and clarify these opportunities, taking into account possible constraints, and generate innovative ideas, solutions, and actions to advance progress in transdisciplinary research.</p>
            
              <p><b>Question(s)</b></p>
              <p>What is standing in the way of progress? Where are the opportunities to advance CHDs through transdisciplinary approaches? What needs to change? What are the change drivers/barriers? What actions do we need to take now to make progress? Where are the opportunities for global research to accelerate progress?</p>
            
              <p><b>Process</b></p>
              <p>A carefully selected group of up to 120 individuals who demonstrate collaborative spirit, open-mindedness, and represent diverse disciplines, backgrounds, and perspectives will be chosen from the pool of applicants to participate in a series of 5 half-day virtual sessions. The application process is open to all, including individuals who participated in Stage 1. The primary goals of this stage are as follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Review and refine the list of unique CHDs research opportunities identified in Stage 1 that are suitable for novel transdisciplinary research approaches, considering both their potential impact and feasibility.</li>
                <li>Generate ideas and strategies for leveraging global research to accelerate progress in addressing CHDs.</li>
                <li>Trace back to the current state of CHDs research, identify the constraints that hinder transdisciplinary research, and brainstorm a range of creative solutions to advance transdisciplinary CHDs research in pursuit of these opportunities.</li>
                <li>Dive deeper into each opportunity, thoroughly examine the associated constraints and potential solutions, and engage in ideation on a wide array of actions to bring about the necessary changes, taking into account both domestic and global perspectives.</li>
              </ol>
            <p><b>Desired Outcome</b></p>
            <p>The creation of comprehensive white papers that summarize a collection of distinctive CHDs research opportunities, both domestic and global, which are highly suitable for transdisciplinary research. These white papers will encompass an examination of the constraints associated with CHDs research as well as propose a range of solutions and actionable steps to advance transdisciplinary research approaches. Ultimately, the goal is to accelerate progress and promote equity in cancer control.</p>

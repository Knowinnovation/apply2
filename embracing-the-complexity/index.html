            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The NCI Health Disparities Innovation Lab Project is an exciting initiative that aims to accelerate progress in advancing cancer health equity. Join us as we embrace the complexity of cancer health disparities (CHDs) and catalyze transdisciplinary approaches to uncover sustainable solutions. This collaborative event brings together experts from diverse sectors to address the persistent challenges of CHDs and drive meaningful change.</p>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Addressing the complex web of factors contributing to cancer health disparities (CHDs) requires innovative approaches that integrate knowledge across disciplines and communities. By leveraging the expertise of diverse stakeholders, we aim to identify high-impact interventions and develop novel conceptual frameworks to reduce CHDs. Join us in this challenge to accelerate progress towards achieving health equity for all populations.</p>
          
            <h3>The Event</h3>
            <p>The NCI Health Disparities Innovation Lab Project will consist of a series of events: 3 Virtual Challenge Exploration MicroLabs and 5 Virtual Scoping Labs representing diverse groups and organizations. These events will be split between 2 key phases with each workshop being highly interactive and building on the outcomes of the previous workshop. These events are being facilitated by KnowInnovation, a company that specializes in working with science groups to accelerate scientific innovation and achieve actionable outcomes.</p>
           
            <h4><b>PHASE 01</b></h4>
            <p>The Virtual Challenge Exploration Microlabs serve as a vital precursor to the scoping labs, establishing the foundation for the upcoming events. The microlabs aim to articulate the central "challenge" and generate enthusiasm among individuals from diverse disciplines, organizations, and perspectives to actively contribute to this challenge. The microlabs will be organized around three thematic areas:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Embracing complexities</li>
              <li>Integrating knowledge across disciplines, formats, and systems</li>
              <li>Meaningfully engaging impacted communities</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Process</b></p>
            <p>We will conduct a series of 3 virtual events, each lasting 1.5 hours, with a dedicated focus on 1 of the 3 thematic areas mentioned above. Individuals from various disciplines, settings, and contexts will be invited and encouraged to participate in these virtual events, with a capacity of up to 400 participants per event. Each virtual event will commence with an introduction by a subject matter expert in Cancer Health Disparities (CHDs), providing an overview of the specific thematic area and highlighting the gaps and challenges within it. Participants will then be prompted to further explore the theme, share their perspectives, generate relevant questions, and offer suggestions. The output from these microlabs will feed into the subsequent scoping sessions, including suggestions for the required expertise to be included. Additionally, participants will receive information on how to apply for the virtual scoping sessions during these events.</p>
            <p><b>Desired Outcomes</b></p>
            <p>Through the Virtual Challenge Exploration Microlabs, we aim to foster an enthusiastic community that possesses a clear understanding of the challenge at hand and the purpose of the scoping sessions. Participants will gain a deeper comprehension of the expertise necessary for addressing the challenge within the three thematic areas. The microlabs will effectively engage and prepare the community for the scoping sessions, ensuring that the subsequent discussions are well-informed and inclusive.</p>
            
            <h4><b>PHASE 02</b></h4>
            <p>The Virtual Scoping Labs aim to bring together a diverse group of individuals to participate in a series of virtual events. These events are designed to identify and explore specific opportunities for transdisciplinary research approaches in addressing well-defined challenges related to reducing Cancer Health Disparities (CHDs) both in the United States and globally.</p>
            <p><b>Process</b></p>
            <p>We invite individuals from various disciplines, settings, and contexts to apply for participation in 5 half-day virtual events. We will carefully select approximately 100 individuals who demonstrate a collaborative spirit, open-mindedness, and represent a wide range of disciplines, backgrounds, and perspectives. The objective is to introduce different disciplinary communities to one another, fostering a platform for mutual learning. We aim to develop a shared language and a common conceptual understanding of the factors that cause, sustain, or reduce known CHDs. Together, we will identify the crucial uncertainties and gaps in our current understanding.</p>
            <p><b>Desired Outcomes</b></p>
            <p>Through the Virtual Scoping Labs, we aim to achieve a shared language and a common conceptual understanding of the current state of knowledge regarding CHDs. This includes highlighting the inherent challenges and opportunities for transdisciplinary research approaches. The insights and discussions generated during these sessions will be condensed into concise white papers. These papers will articulate unique opportunities that are well-suited to transdisciplinary approaches, facilitating accelerated progress in addressing CHDs in both the US and global contexts. From the scoping sessions, 1-2 identified opportunities will be selected for further in-depth exploration in consecutive phases, creating a foundation for future projects with a focused framework for impactful CHD research.</p>

            <h3>Who Should Attend</h3>
            <p>The NCI Health Disparities Innovation Lab Project welcomes participants from a diverse range of sectors and backgrounds.

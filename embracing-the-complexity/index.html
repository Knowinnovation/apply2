            <h3>The Challenge + Call to Action</h3>
            <p>Cancer health disparities (CHD) are, simply put, wicked problems.  Despite the investments in time and money made by dedicated scientists and community stakeholders, the problem of CHDs has remained recalcitrant to solutions using standard approaches, leaving many of us feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. <b>Do you have bold ideas on how to advance research to accelerate progress towards cancer health equity? Are you open to collaboratively explore ‘out-of-the-box’ ideas outside your usual area of work? Be part of the solution.</b>
            </p>
            <p>The complex nature of CHD requires broader thinking, open-minded approaches, and collaborative partnerships. Join colleagues from a wide range of fields and communities to ideate and explore bold, innovative and transformative research ideas to catalyze new research directions towards sustainable solutions for CHD. What can we do together, working across research fields and communities, employing new trans-disciplinary approaches, that we cannot do alone or via the more traditional and siloed approaches?  Through a series of workshops, we will explore unique research opportunities that are best addressed by working together and advancing new approaches that cut across disciplines to tackle the complex nature of CHD and accelerate progress towards reducing CHD.  
            </p>
            <p>By participating in this event, you will have the opportunity to:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ensure that your perspectives are considered to inform new directions for CHD research.</li>
                <li>Actively contribute to cutting-edge research ideas.</li>
                <li>Forge new collaborations with experts from diverse fields to drive meaningful change.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Working together through this series of workshops, we can envision a more trans-disciplinary future of CHD research and accelerate progress towards cancer health equity for all populations, both locally and globally.
            </p>

            <h3>Who Should Attend</h3>
            <p>We welcome participants with diverse perspectives from broad sectors in society, including academia, industry, government, non-profit, and community to ensure that multiple perspectives are considered to inform transformative research directions in CHD. Furthermore, we encourage a mix of individuals whose expertise cut across a wide range of disciplines in the research, policy and social advocacy arena to attend, including those involved in community engagement, social and policy planning, and basic, translational, behavioral, and social sciences. Above all else, it is critical that attendees are open to exploring approaches that may be very different from their usual research or advocacy approaches.

            <h3>About the Workshops</h3>
            <p>Cancer health disparities (CHD), both globally and locally, result from a complicated interplay of factors across a variety of levels, from individual to interpersonal to environmental to structural.  While researchers across many different fields have made great progress in understanding and proposing solutions, disparities persist across the continuum of cancer risk, detection, progression, and outcomes.  Building on existing theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and research across many different disciplines, community engagement, as well as on themes gleaned from the recent request for information and listening session, the NCI will hold a series of workshops, facilitated by KnowInnovation. Participants will identify unique research opportunities, and collaboratively ideate around approaches that cut across disciplines to advance sustainable solutions to reduce CHD and accelerate progress towards equity in cancer control for all populations.   
            </p>
            <p>The virtual workshops are designed to be intense, interactive, and free-thinking, involving a broad range of individuals. These dynamic workshops will be organized in two sequential stages, with each stage building on the outcomes of the previous stage. 
            </p>
            <p>More about each stage:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The first stage will begin with a series of three short (1.5 hours) virtual interactive workshops designed to broadly engage a diverse community in small interactive discussions to <b>ideate and share new ideas</b> around research approaches that cut across disciplines.  Registration is open to everyone and all who register will participate.</li>
              <li>The second stage will build on the ideas from the first stage and will comprise a series of five in-depth (4 hours) virtual interactive workshops designed to <b>coalesce, focus, and refine the ideas</b> into strong themes and opportunities that can serve as the foundation for new research directions in the science of CHD.  This stage will involve additional cross-discipline discussions and conclude with a series of white papers summarizing the themes and opportunities for broad dissemination. Interested individuals must apply and be selected to participate.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Event Outcomes</h3>
            <p>The ultimate goal of this event is to envision a more cross-disciplinary future of CHD research and accelerate progress towards cancer health equity for all populations, both locally and globally. We envision meaningful outcomes towards advancing the science of CHD. Collectively, the event will:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Foster a shared conceptual understanding of CHD and contribute to cutting-edge research ideas.</li>
              <li>Address constraints and identify a range of solutions to advance new CHD research directions that cut across multiple disciplines to address the complex nature of CHD, ultimately working towards achieving equity in cancer control for all populations.</li>
              <li>Generate comprehensive white papers and resources that summarize a collection of transformative distinctive CHD research opportunities, both domestic and global, which are highly suitable for cross-disciplinary research and disseminated across a wide range of stakeholders.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Following two virtual microlabs, an in-person workshop was held June 12-14, 2023 in Boise, ID to continue development of community priorities, formation of connections among Biological Science community members, and creation of frameworks for successfully conducting ‘use-inspired research and education’. Around 120 attendees were selected from a wider body of around 750 individuals who participated in the online microlab #1 and #2, with particular intentionality placed on representing a broad spectrum of academic institutions and career progressions.  Sectoral representation was equally as diverse, with participants' backgrounds in academic, private, and government communities of all organizational sizes. NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions were notably well-represented, making up about 50% of the participants.
            </p>
            <p>The primary goal of the in-person workshop was to engage diverse stakeholder communities, fostering awareness of the reciprocal benefits that strong partnerships could bring to a gradient of  basic through applied science. The time in Boise successfully identified shared interests, addressed community needs, and identified barriers to functional partnerships. Participants heard directly from Dr. Erwin Gianchandani from NSF TIP and from Dr. J.D. Swanson from NSF EPSCoR who each highlighted the importance of use-inspired research and education in their programs. Valuable knowledge from past use-inspired science initiatives was shared, and recommendations for new structures and processes that could accelerate research translation into innovations for societal benefit were developed.

            <h3>Emergence of Core Community Priorities</h3>
            <p>Eight core themes (referred to as ‘Umbrella Working Groups’ [UWG]) emerged with the Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) umbrella serving as an overarching framework for all working groups to include as they advance community initiatives. 
            </p>
            <p>Themes of the umbrellas included:

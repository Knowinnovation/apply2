      The Banner section contains the Title, a Call to Action Button, and a Background image.
      To change the background image:
      1. Add new image to ../../images/ folder
      2. Open main.css
      3. Press Ctrl+F and search "banner"
      4. Replace "banner.jpg" with the new image name in the following:
            background-image: url('../../images/banner.jpg');
      Note: keep the ../../images/ if the new image is stored in the images folder

      OR change the background image by deleting "banner.jpg" in the images folder and then upload a new image titled "banner.jpg" to the same location.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>To maintain global leadership in biological science (BioSci) innovation, new processes are needed that improve collaborations among academic, private, and governmental BioSci communities to facilitate the translation of basic research to innovation and to better inform evidence-based practices. The current and next generation of researchers lack clear support pathways and training opportunities for careers in use-inspired research and science-informed practices.</p>
            
            <hr>

            <h3>About the Workshop</h3>
            <p>This NSF-funded workshop will build new connections among key BioSci communities. The organizing committee has planned a series of virtual (for an unlimited number of participants) and in-person (for 120 selected participants representing diverse groups and organizations) events. These events are facilitated by KnowInnovation, a company that specializes in working with science groups to accelerate scientific innovation and achieve actionable outcomes. The agenda is designed to be highly interactive, discussion- and solution-based, with background reading materials provided in advance.</p>
            <p><bold>Workshop Goals:</bold></p>

            <p><ul></p>
              <p><li>Engage academic, private and governmental communities in building awareness of the reciprocal benefits of strong partnerships among organizations</li>
<li>Identify shared interests, community needs, and barriers to functional partnerships</li>
<li>Develop recommendations for new structures and processes that will accelerate the translation of research to innovation 
</li>
<li>Develop recommendations for new structures and processes that will accelerate the translation of research to innovation </li>
<li>Enhance and expand inclusive and experiential training opportunities to prepare a globally competitive, STEM-adaptable workforce.</li></p></ul>
<p>The ultimate anticipated outcomes of the workshop are documents that will guide and facilitate use-inspired research and science-informed practices. Documents co-created by participants and shared with STEM communities may include:
</p><ul><li>Training and career pathway diagrams</li>
<li>Recommendations for “use-inspired” tracks for future NSF solicitations</li>
<li>Call to action papers with recommended practices and policies across academic and non-academic organizations</li>
<li>Logic models that can support use-inspired research across STEM communities</li></ul>

            <h3>Virtual MicroLabs</h3>
            <p>A microlab is an interactive, virtual event using a video conferencing platform similar to Zoom. The goal of the virtual microlab sessions is to identify common needs, benefits, and challenges of academic, private, and government organizations that seek to remain relevant and contribute to advancing science, engineering, and education in the future. During the microlabs, you’ll develop ideas in collaboration with fellow participants.</p>
            <p><bold>Microlab Dates</bold></p>
            <p><ul><li>Friday, April 14 from noon to 2 p.m. MST</li>
<li>Friday, May 12 from noon to 2 p.m. MST</li></ul></p>
            

            <h3>Register to Attend</h3>
            <p>Academic, private, and government leaders and researchers from early to senior career stages, including graduate students, are encouraged to attend. Original thinkers from outside academia (e.g., industry) and are also strongly encouraged to join this interactive event. All participants should be willing to engage in frank disclosure and assessment of ideas in a collegial and professional fashion following an established code of conduct. There is no registration fee to attend the virtual MicroLabs.</p>

            <p><h3>In-Person Scoping Session</h3></p>
            <p>The in-person Scoping Session will be held at Boise State University, Boise, Idaho from  June 26 – 28, 2023. The goal of the in-person scoping session is to create collaborative working groups who will publish educational and career pathways, “call to action” papers, and draft future funding calls in consultation with NSF program officers, academic administrators, and non-academic partners.
</p>
            <p><bold>Who Should Apply</bold></p>
            <p>Application information for the in-person Scoping Session is coming soon! </p>

<p>Applications will be reviewed by a panel using a rubric aligned with workshop goals. Participant selection notification is expected by May 25, 2023. Travel funding for all in-person participants is anticipated through a grant from The National Science Foundation.</p>
 
</p>
<p><h3>Post-Scoping MicroLabs</h3></p>
<p>
The organizers will hold two virtual MicroLabs after the in-person Scoping Session to focus on generating publications of workshop recommendations and outcomes that will be shared with our broader communities. Dates and more information are forthcoming. </p>

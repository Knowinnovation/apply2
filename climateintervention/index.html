            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In October and November 2024, the U.S. National Science Foundation will gather a group of selected participants to discuss research directions of climate intervention: its risks, impacts, and successes, best practices of governance and ethics, and where we need to know more.</p>
            <p>We need your expertise and perspective to identify and address the critical research questions that will expand our understanding of the ethical and social considerations of deploying ocean and land Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Solar Radiation Management (SRM) strategies (reference here the three NASEM reports of relevance).</p>
            <p>These NSF-sponsored workshops are designed to shape the boundaries of possible future strategies for CDR and SRM while addressing the ethical and social dynamics that will be critical in outlining the potential development and implementation of these strategies.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The rapid reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions remains a top priority. The scientific community has urged federal agencies to support research on CDR and SRM strategies as a means to address greenhouse gas emission concerns These strategies encompass a broad and growing range of techniques, each with specific potential environmental and societal impacts and (possibly) unintended consequences. Numerous reports (add links) demand that strategies deemed to be potentially effective must be co-developed in an environmentally and socially responsible manner that includes community-engaged research, as well as promotes and adheres to appropriate ethical and governance frameworks.</p>

            <h3>What is the Challenge?</h3>
            <p>As we face the urgent need to mitigate climate change, we must weigh the risks of implementing CDR and SRM strategies against the risks of inaction. This requires a holistic and interdisciplinary approach, integrating advances in both natural and social sciences. The ethical and social dynamics of CDR and SRM are key considerations in the conversation around climate technologies, as they have prevented broader acceptance of these strategies to date. Furthermore, the success of the potential implementation and public acceptance of these interventions is contingent on their engineering feasibility, scales, and public health implications.</p>
          
            <h3>What will we do?</h3>
            <p>Participants will consider the ethical and social dynamics arising as the world debates deploying large-scale ocean and land Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Solar Radiation Management (SRM) strategies.</p>
            <p>During a series of five half-day workshops and an initial microlab sessions, scientists and engineers within the domains of the atmosphere, land and oceans will explore visions for what research is feasible within the CDR and SRM realms. The first three workshops will focus on the atmosphere and SRM, the land and CDR, and the ocean and mCDR, and include both natural and social scientists. During the final two workshops, which will be limited to social scientists, we will identify any potential ethics and governance aspects we may have overlooked and discuss research opportunities to address such gaps.</p>
            
            <h3>What are the outputs?</h3>
            <p>We anticipate that we will generate a portfolio of research questions which would allow us to inform robust governance and ethics protocols around climate intervention.</p>
            <p>It is also likely that discussions will foster new and strengthen existing inter-disciplinary collaboration between social scientists, ethicists, natural and life scientists and engineers, from across all sectors to help create a wholistic approach to potential deployment of climate intervention strategies.</p>

            <p>The workshops welcome unconventional thinking to help frame the bounds of viable strategies for CDR and SRM while addressing the pressing challenges of the ethical and social dynamics that will be so critical in developing and implementing these strategies.</p>
            <p>We anticipate over 100 people from diverse backgrounds will join us. By participating, you will:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Help shape the research agenda in this critical area.</li>
            <li>Engage with an interdisciplinary network of experts and relevant groups.</li>
            <li>Contribute to groundbreaking research that addresses the natural science, ethical, social, engineering, and public health impacts of climate intervention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Join us in this vital effort to explore and address the complexities of climate intervention. Your insights and participation are crucial to our success.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In October and November 2024, the U.S. National Science Foundation will gather a group of selected participants to discuss one of societyâ€™s most pressing issues: climate intervention.</p>
            <p>We need your expertise and perspective to identify and address the critical research questions that will expand our understanding of the ethical and social dynamics that need to be considered as the world debates deploying large-scale Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (mCDR) and Solar Radiation Management (SRM) strategies.
            <p>These NSF-sponsored  workshops are designed to frame the boundaries of possible future strategies for CDR and SRM while addressing the pressing challenges of the ethical and social dynamics that will be critical in  shaping the development and implementation of these strategies.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The rapid reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions remains the a top priority. However, the scientific community has urged federal agencies to support research on additional potential solutions and their consequences, including CDR and SRM strategies. These strategies encompass a broad and growing range of techniques, each with specific potential environmental and societal impacts and (possibly) unintended consequences. Numerous reports (add links) demand that strategies deemed to be potentially effective must be co-developed in an environmentally and socially responsible manner that includes community-engaged research, promoting and adhering to an agreed ethical and governance framework.</p>

            <h3>What is the Challenge?</h3>
            <p>As we face the urgent need to mitigate climate change, we must weigh the risks of implementing CDR and SRM strategies against the risks of inaction. This requires a holistic and iterative approach, integrating advances in both physical and social sciences. The ethical and social dynamics are central, as they have prevented broader acceptance of these strategies to date. Furthermore, considering the engineering feasibility, scales, and public health implications of these interventions is crucial to their potential successful implementation and public acceptance.</p>
          
            <h3>What will we do?</h3>
            <p>Participants will consider the ethical and social dynamics arising as the world debates deploying large-scale Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), both from the sea and land, and Solar Radiation Management (SRM) strategies. </p>
            <p>During a series of workshops, science experts within the domains of the Atmosphere, Land and Oceans will explore visions for what is scientifically possible. We will then identify gaps in terms of ethics and governance through a social science lens before discussing research opportunities to fill those gaps.</p>
            <p>We are planning a series of five half-day workshops, complemented by an initial microlab session. The first three workshops will focus on the ocean and mCDR, the atmosphere and SRM, and the land and CDR and  include both physical and social scientists. The final two workshops will be limited to social scientists, with key physical scientists also attending to provide necessary insights.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>DATES: Consectetur lorem donec massa sapien faucibus et molestie ac.</li>
              <li>FORMAT: Adipiscing enim eu turpis egestas pretium aenean pharetra magna ac.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who Should Apply?</h3>
            <p>The workshops welcome outside-the-box thinking to help frame the bounds of viable strategies for CDR and SRM while addressing the pressing challenges of the ethical and social dynamics that will be so critical in developing and implementing these strategies.</p>
            <p>We anticipate around 60 people from diverse backgrounds will participate. By participating, you will:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Help shape the research agenda in this critical area.</li>
            <li>Engage with a network of experts and stakeholders.</li>
            <li>Contribute to groundbreaking research that addresses the ethical, social, engineering, and public health impacts of climate intervention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Join us in this vital effort to explore and address the complexities of climate intervention. Your insights and participation are crucial to our success.</p>

            -->
           
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>We need your expertise and perspective to identify and address the critical research questions that will expand our understanding of the ethical and social dynamics that need to be considered as the world debates deploying large-scale CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal, with marine, mCDR, considered in a separate event from other types of CDR) and SRM (Solar Radiation Management) strategies. The NSF-sponsored  workshops are designed to frame the bounds of viable strategies for CDR and SRM while addressing the pressing challenges of the ethical and social dynamics that will be critical in  shaping the development and implementation of these strategies.</p>
            <p>From TK- TK in October 2024, the U.S. National Science Foundation is virtually gathering a group of selected participants to discuss one of society’s most pressing issues: climate intervention.</p>
            <p>Participants will consider the ethical and social dynamics arising as the world debates deploying large-scale Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), both from the sea and land, and Solar Radiation Management (SRM) strategies. </p>
            <p>During a series of workshops, a set of experts will propose its visions for what is scientifically possible. Another set will identify gaps through a social science lens. Everyone will discuss research opportunities to fill those gaps.</p>
            <p>The workshops welcome outside-the-box thinking to help frame the bounds of viable strategies for CDR and SRM while addressing the pressing challenges of the ethical and social dynamics that will be so critical in developing and implementing these strategies.</p>

            <h3>The Background</h3>
            <p>The rapid reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions remains the a top priority. However, the scientific community has urged federal agencies to support research on additional potential solutions and their consequences, including CDR and SRM strategies. These strategies encompass a broad and growing range of techniques, each with specific potential environmental and societal impacts and unintended consequences. Numerous reports (add links) demand that strategies deemed to be potentially effective must be co-developed in an environmentally and socially responsible manner that includes community-engaged research, promoting and adhering to open scientific research principles.</p>
            <p>Important questions arise, e.g., “Can we use these strategies safely?” in the context of risk vs. risk—the risk of not implementing them vs. the unintended consequences of implementing them?</p>
            <p>Governments around the world agree that rapidly reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is the top priority to combat climate change.</p>
            <p>However, the scientific community has concurrently urged federal agencies to support research on additional potential actions, including CDR and SRM strategies. Although these actions, collectively referred to as climate intervention, encompass a broad and growing range of techniques, they each come with potential impacts and unintended consequences to both the environment and society. </p>
            <p>Numerous (gov/sci/policy) reports demand that any viable strategy must be co-developed in an environmentally and socially responsible manner that engages (what kind of) community while promoting and adhering to open scientific research principles. </p>
            <p>There are still important questions to address. Can we use these strategies safely? In the context of risk vs. risk— how do we weigh the risk of not implementing them vs. the unintended consequences of implementing them?</p>
          
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>As we face the urgent need to mitigate climate change, we must weigh the risks of implementing CDR and SRM strategies against the risks of inaction. This requires a holistic and iterative approach, integrating advances in both physical and social sciences. The ethical and social dynamics are central, as they have prevented broader acceptance of these strategies to date. Furthermore, considering the engineering feasibility, scales, and public health implications of these interventions is crucial to their potential successful implementation and public acceptance.</p>
          
            <h3>The Event</h3>
            <p>We are planning a series of five half-day workshops, complemented by an initial microlab session. The first three workshops will focus on the ocean and mCDR, the atmosphere and SRM, and the land and CDR and  include both physical and social scientists. The final two workshops will be limited to social scientists, with key physical scientists also attending to provide necessary insights.</p>

              <h3>Join Our Information Happy Hour to say Hi & Learn More!</h3>
              <p><strong>September 9th - 5:00pm to 6:00pm ET</strong></p>
              <p>We'll be hosting a 60-minute interactive online session to introduce the opportunity and goals of our event, and to give you a chance to meet your peers and experience a little bit of what our series will be like.</p>
              </p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Circular economy (CE) aims to decouple economic growth from resource consumption by cycling products and materials back into production, either by returning materials to generate new products, or by releasing benign substances to the environment through degradation. A truly circular economy keeps material in continuous use by design. The overall adoption of CE principles has been incremental at best – especially in the US.  To achieve – or even begin to achieve – a circular economy, a convergent research approach needs to be employed as a multitude of disciplines -- from material science, chemistry, biology, engineering, business, economics, social sciences, and behavioral sciences need to work in concert for circularity.  Thus, we are inviting you to be a part of this journey. By deeply integrating these diverse disciplines, we can begin to work on tackling the complex challenges that currently inhibit the growth of the circular economy today.</p>
        <p>The US lags far behind in CE design research and policy formulation in comparison with our UK, EU, and Asian colleagues, and our plan is to include a retrospective/lessons learned session from policy makers to inform the research community. A key outcome would be to learn where current policies create barriers to wider implementation of circular concepts.  It is noteworthy that the emerging CE-based studies resemble many of the same conversations that occurred in the biomass conversion community starting in the early 2000s. Given the successes and failures of the biofuels and bioproducts community, we propose to include some aspects of learning from this community related to scale-up, development of rigorous standards and protocols to enable comparisons of various design and reuse strategies, and the need for early and comprehensive analyses for sustainability and supply chains.
 </p>
            <h3>Date and Location</h3>
            <p><strong>The event will be held online from 12:00- 3:00 PM EDT, and will take place on September 18th, 24th and 30th</strong></p>
            <p>Ideally you will be able to attend all three sessions; however, if you are unable to do so, the RSVP form allows you to select which sessions you can attend.  We will also be recording sessions.</p>
            <p>There will also be some required pre-work and light background reading/viewing.</p>
            <h3>Who is Attending</h3>
            <p>Our stakeholder community includes the research/academic community, government, industry, non-profits, foundations, and international partners. We strike a balance between breadth and depth A key point of the workshop is to understand how all of these groups work together and eventually converge on solutions.</p>
 
 <ul>
<li>Academic community</li>
<li>Professional societies</li>
<li>Non-profits and Foundationsz</li>
<li>International considerations</li>
<li>Governmental entities</li>
<li>Industry stakeholders</li>
<li>Individual companies</li>
<li>Investment and Incubation</li>
        </ul>
</p>
            <p>We are most interested in new, innovative ideas and original thinking that arise from new collaborations between people of diverse backgrounds and varying expertise.</p>
            <p> All participants should be willing to engage in frank disclosure and assessment of ideas in a collegial and professional fashion. To facilitate open sharing, all meeting discussions will be considered a private communication and not to be shared outside of the meeting, unless approved by the contributor. All research-related application information will be kept confidential.</p>
